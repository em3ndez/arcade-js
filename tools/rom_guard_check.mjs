// Does the repo still keep the promise README makes to a stranger? Quickstart says to run
// `npm test` and that ROM-dependent tests "skip cleanly if you haven't built one" -- the only path
// an outside reader ever takes, since nobody outside owns the ROMs.
//
// EMPIRICAL by necessity: two guard idioms are live, and the shadow idiom (dkong, thepit, and
// timeplt's own assembled-swap) wraps `test` conditionally, so its calls read as unguarded while
// being guarded -- a `romsPresent` grep condemns every healthy dkong test file. A third idiom
// invented later would break a static check silently.
//
// ROM images are gitignored, so a `git clone` has none BY CONSTRUCTION -- a stranger's clone, not a
// simulation of one, `.git` included. An earlier version used `git checkout-index` and
// registry-coverage failed there only because an export is not a repository: a false positive
// manufactured by the apparatus.
//
// Rationale and worked examples: docs/reviewer-rules.md, R26.
