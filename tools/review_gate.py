"""Review gate — make an independent review a MECHANICAL PREREQUISITE for every commit.

The top-level rule: no commit lands until a SEPARATE reviewer has read exactly those
staged changes and recorded a PASS. Memory and docs cannot enforce that — an agent that
forgets ships unreviewed code. A git hook can: it refuses the commit.

How it works
------------
* ``diff_id`` = sha256 of the staged diff (``git diff --cached``, stable flags incl.
  ``--full-index`` so the id does not drift with ``core.abbrev``). It changes the instant
  the staged content changes, so a review is bound to the EXACT bytes that will be
  committed. Review v1 then edit to v2 and the token no longer matches — you are forced to
  re-review the change.
* A reviewer records ``.reviews/<diff_id>.json`` after reading the staged diff. The file holds
  ``{"diff_id": ..., "verdicts": [...]}`` — an APPEND-ONLY list, oldest first.
* The ``pre-commit`` hook runs ``check``: the LATEST verdict must be PASS, else exit 1.

Why the history is kept
-----------------------
``record`` used to overwrite, so a PASS recorded over an earlier FAIL erased it. That made an
honest re-adjudication (a reviewer shown new evidence, overturning itself on its own
reasoning) BYTE-IDENTICAL to a quiet erasure. It also left the "a confirmer's written
objection stops a promotion" rule with no artifact — nothing could show whether a unit had
ever been blocked. Appending costs nothing and keeps that answerable.

Files written by the older single-verdict version are still read correctly: a token holding a
bare ``{"verdict": ...}`` is treated as a one-element history. Nothing needed migrating, and
nothing was rewritten.

So the only path to a commit is: stage -> review (writes the token) -> commit.

FAIL CLOSED: any git error (not-a-repo, a failing ``git diff``) blocks the commit rather
than being mistaken for an empty diff. A gate that errors open is worthless.

Honest limits (stated, not hidden)
----------------------------------
``git commit --no-verify`` bypasses any local hook, and a misbehaving agent could forge a
token. History-rewrite paths (rebase -x / cherry-pick / revert / auto-merge) do not fire
pre-commit at all. This gate stops FORGETTING — the actual failure mode here — not a
determined bypass; hard enforcement needs a server-side check on push. reviewer != author
is recorded but not cryptographically enforced.
