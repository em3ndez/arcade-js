 * coldBootReset — the power-on reset entry (reset-vector target). Clears all work/stack/video/object RAM,

 *   - switch idle (normal boot): snapshot the option switches, seed a few flags, load and validate the
 *     high-score mirror from NVRAM, then hand off to the game entry.
 *   - switch held (operator self-test): march RAM and the memory pages, beeping any failure, and otherwise
 *     draw the test screens or hand off to the checksum display.
 * The self-test marches poll the beam and the service switch, so they are inherently clock-coupled. [code]
 *
 * A generator: the normal path delegates into the main-loop spine, whose vblank yields propagate up to the
 * clock-free engine. Isolated capture-replay can't drive a forever-yielding boot, so this spine entry is
 * engine-validated (whole-machine convergence) rather than by an isolated capture test.
