# frogger — §5 adversarial done-audit (DONE)

**Verdict: DONE — zero open criteria.** Every §5 completion criterion PASSES under independently
re-run gates and re-derived heavy checks (the §3-completeness crawl from scratch, the pixel --done bar on
both layers, the whole-game + equivalence suites, naming and grounding, and a null-mutant on the audio
gate). The single item this audit opened — a `tools/audio_gate.py selftest` regression the de-grandfather
retrofit introduced — is CLOSED in this same done-marker commit (see the audio row and the CLOSED ITEM
section).

- **Audited commit:** this done-marker commit, which adds this `DONE.md` plus a **selftest-only** fix to
  `tools/audio_gate.py` (invaders precedent: `DONE.md` + a minor fix in one done-marker commit). The
  substantive game state audited is `94784581d0d476335211fe2cdb32ce3adb783c2b`
  (`frogger: full-gameplay pixel --done gate; de-grandfather from attract-only`, HEAD == origin/main at
  audit time); the added `audio_gate.py` change touches only `def selftest()` and changes **no** gate
  verdict for any game (proven below), so the substantive audit carries unchanged.
- **Auditor (proposer):** fresh adversarial §5 done-auditor, Claude Opus 4.8 (Claude Code agent),
  dispatched by Jimmy-arcade2. Proposer≠confirmer applied to the done-CLAIM itself: this audit re-ran
  every gate and re-derived the heavy checks (the §3-completeness crawl from scratch, the pixel --done
  bar on both layers, the whole-game + equivalence suites, the naming and grounding surfaces, and a
  null-mutant on the audio gate), never trusting "the gates are green." Committing this file triggers
  `review_gate`; its reviewer is a SECOND independent agent that re-runs the FULL §5 audit against this
  commit (reviewer-rule R40) — not a read of this file.
- **ROM sha256 (verified against disk AND `manifest.js`, three assembled images + the pinned audio ROM):**
  - `maincpu` (game program, parts frogger.606/607/608 assembled to 0x0000–0x0fff): 
    `f8c0a2ef4105769c627b7bbf13d0844ada8bbe43c00d177eb90dd395d1e3a1e5` — disk `rom/maincpu.bin` ==
    `manifest.images.maincpu.sha256` (both agree; equals the value the dispatch specified).
  - `gfx` (assembled, D0<->D1 swapped): `2718b9527bbd9bfdb5af4b35275b34dd8660d529bc1f4eaeb336ddd6589a238a`
    — disk `rom/gfx.bin` == manifest.
  - `proms`: `db633922b57b4e033df7b8a7fc710c942bdf486821d3895ca413337ade532667` — disk `rom/proms.bin`
    == manifest.
  - audio-CPU ROM (frogger.608/609/610 concatenated, 6144 B — NOT assembled into the manifest; the audio
    CPU is modelled by record/replay): `a5dd222819cfbb81a9bf10197d9c21320e7ee6c0bc1441fb87dbedd511562b5c`
    — pinned in `audio/RECORDING-SIGNOFF.md`.

## Per-§5-criterion verdict table

| Criterion | Verdict | Concrete evidence (command + key numbers) |
|---|---|---|
| **§3 completeness** (the biggest trap) | PASS | **Re-derived from scratch, unpinned, deep, with a positive control.** A deep UNPINNED idiomatic crawl (`runIdiomaticGame`, coin/start + a long hop tape) runs **20000 frames CLEAN — `stopError=null`, `stop="reached maxFrames"`**. Non-vacuity witnessed: **all six `GAME_MODE` values seen (0x0,0x1,0x2,0x3,0x4,0x5)**, `PLAY_FLAG` 0→1 with **538 in-play frames**, **110 distinct `FROG_Y` positions across 0x00–0xe0** (frog crossed the whole board — river to bottom), `LIVES_COUNT` **1→0** (deaths + game-over reached). No dispatch throw (m.call NotImplemented nor undefined computed-dispatch) over the deep run. **Positive control:** deleting a reached routine from the routines map makes the crawl THROW `NotImplemented: no routine registered at 0x0066` at frame 1 — the crawl bites when a reached routine is absent. The pure-translated oracle cannot be crawled deep (its nested m.call trampolining overflows the JS stack — the very reason the idiomatic coroutine layer exists), so deep-gameplay completeness rests on this idiomatic crawl + `unlifted=0` static closure + idiomatic==oracle equivalence below. |
| **idiomatic gate** | PASS | `python3 tools/idiomatic_gate.py worklist frogger` → `frogger: total 0 [registers=0 calls=0 pushes=0 addrs=0 mem=0 masks=0 stack=0 unlifted=0]`. Zero CPU/memory cruft AND zero reachable routines still oracle-served. |
| **wiring** | PASS | `python3 tools/done_gate.py check --game frogger` → `wiring [OK] PASS (registry-coverage, no-stale-mcall, no-frozen-twin-call)`. Every idiomatic module dispatched; no `m.call` into the frozen layer; no frozen-twin call. |
| **grounding (stage-B)** | PASS | `done_gate.py check --game frogger` → `grounding [OK] fully grounded`. No `grounding-debt.txt` exists — frogger is grounded outright (no accounted-for residuals). |
| **naming** | PASS | No routine's own name is `loc_` (`grep -c 'name: "loc_' idiomatic/names.js` → 0; parsed 164 ROUTINES entries, **0 with a loc_ own-name, 0 grounded routines left as loc_**); no `loc_*.js` modules in `idiomatic/`; no `names-debt.txt` needed. The 6 renames in commit `c39ad889` are all grounded ([seen]/[seen,poked]) and descriptive (`loc_0292→tickFrogRespawnDelay`, `loc_05d3→armBoardCompleteReveal`, `loc_0c4a→stampRankMarkerIfPlaced`, `loc_23eb→advanceHomeBaySlotCursor`, `loc_27ea→driveDiveAnimByLevel`, `loc_29f9→moveSpriteObjectArmA`) — value-identical retrofit, frozen translated oracle untouched. (`done_gate` still labels naming "legacy grandfathered," but the direct check confirms zero grounded loc_ regardless.) |
| **audio** | PASS (enforcing, teeth proven, selftest green) | `python3 tools/audio_gate.py check --game frogger` → `OK (model=clips; map + map/wiring tests + recording sign-off)`. **De-grandfathered:** frogger is NOT in `audio_gate.py LEGACY_NO_SIGNOFF = {"timeplt","thepit","dkong"}`. **Teeth null-mutant (independently run):** hiding `RECORDING-SIGNOFF.md` flips the check to `BLOCK — audio not recorded/signed off` (exit 1), then restored byte-identical — so the sign-off requirement genuinely bites for frogger. **Gate selftest green:** `python3 tools/audio_gate.py selftest` → `selftest OK` (exit 0) — the "can this gate even fail?" pass is green (was the sole open item, closed in this commit by the dynamic-legacy-example fix; see CLOSED ITEM). `RECORDING-SIGNOFF.md` valid: `rom_sha256` (audio ROM) present, `clips: 20` > 0, `date: 2026-09-16`, `by_ear` an honest AUTONOMOUS attestation (MAME-sourced clips). `audio-map.test.js` + `audio-wiring.test.js` pass in the whole-game suite. |
| **pixel (--done, full bar)** | PASS | Re-run independently, both layers. `pixel_suite.py --layer idiomatic --done` → `pixel_suite: PASS` — PART A attract completeness (850 golden frames, worst 0.22%, 0 over 5%), PART B tape-driven GAMEPLAY vs MAME (608 frames, 3 tape entries, worst **3.35%**, **0 over 5%**). `--layer oracle --done` → `pixel_suite: PASS` (attract worst 0.11%, gameplay worst 0.22%). **NOT grandfathered:** frogger is NOT in `done_gate.py LEGACY_ATTRACT_ONLY = {"timeplt","thepit"}`; done_gate prints `pixel PASS (--done: attract completeness + gameplay vs MAME)`. Gameplay is non-vacuous (the whole-game vs-oracle test independently witnesses the frog reaching in-play and hopping on both engines). |
| **whole-game gates** | PASS | `node --test games/frogger/test/*.test.js` → **21 tests, 21 pass, 0 fail** (boot/attract "full frame budget, no translation gap"; audio map/wiring; the gameplay tape reaching in-play + moving the frog on BOTH engines; idiomatic gameplay RAM == oracle at a reconverged landmark). |
| **idiomatic equivalence** | PASS | `node --test games/frogger/idiomatic/test/*.test.js` → **370 tests, 370 pass, 0 fail** — every routine == the frozen oracle with TEETH mutation controls (broken twins caught). |
| **cleanup / comments** | PASS | `python3 tools/comment_gate.py check` → `comment_gate: OK` (verbose grounded headers, density under cap). |
| **external disasm (CA)** | PASS (in scope) | `games/frogger/contrib/computerarcheology/` present with `Code.md`, `Hardware.md`, `RAMUse.md`, `README.md` (per-instruction glosses landed in `1773a43d`). |
| **screenshot** | PASS | `games/frogger/screenshot.png` present — 672×768 PNG, portrait (ROT applied), 8 KB selector card. |
| **browser** | PASS | `done_gate.py check --game frogger` → `browser [OK] PASS (worker-form construct+render+input+sound seam)`. |
| **rom_sha256** | PASS | See the header — maincpu/gfx/proms disk == manifest (all three), audio ROM pinned in the sign-off. |

## CLOSED ITEM — audio_gate selftest regression (found by this audit, fixed in this commit)

**Finding (at the audited substantive state `94784581`).** `python3 tools/audio_gate.py selftest`
FAILED: `selftest FAIL: a legacy-named game without a sign-off was blocked (should be grandfathered)` →
`selftest FAILED`.

**Root cause.** Commit `9eb649d3` correctly removed `frogger` from `audio_gate.py`'s `LEGACY_NO_SIGNOFF`
set (from `{"frogger","timeplt","thepit","dkong"}` to `{"timeplt","thepit","dkong"}`), de-grandfathering
frogger onto the sign-off requirement — but it did **not** update the gate's own selftest, whose case
still used `"frogger"` as the *grandfathered* example and asserted `silent_check("frogger",
<no-signoff-tree>) == 0`. Since frogger now REQUIRES a sign-off, that check correctly returns non-zero, so
the stale assertion fired. Confirmed a NEW regression: the same selftest against the parent tree
(`9eb649d3^`) printed `selftest OK`. The runbook's *New-subsystem DONE doctrine* makes the "can this gate
even fail?" pass a precondition of done, so a red gate selftest at the audited commit was a genuine open
item — even though the live enforcement was already fine (proven by the sign-off-removal null-mutant in
the audio row), and even though no central runner auto-invokes the selftest in the commit flow.

**Fix (in this done-marker commit; `def selftest()` only, no gate-logic change).** The selftest now picks
its grandfathered example from the live set — `if LEGACY_NO_SIGNOFF: ... silent_check(sorted(
LEGACY_NO_SIGNOFF)[0], g_legacy)` — so de-grandfathering any future game (timeplt/thepit/dkong) never
stales it again. The `git diff` is confined to `def selftest()`; `check()`, the `LEGACY_NO_SIGNOFF`
membership, and every enforcement path are byte-unchanged.

**Re-verified after the fix:**
- `python3 tools/audio_gate.py selftest` → `selftest OK` (exit 0) — green.
- `python3 tools/audio_gate.py check --game frogger` → `OK (model=clips; ...)` (exit 0) — the gate's
  verdict for frogger is UNCHANGED, so the audio criterion and the other thirteen criteria are unaffected.

## Conclusion

**Zero open criteria.** All §5 criteria PASS under independently re-run gates and re-derived heavy checks:
§3-completeness holds under a deep unpinned idiomatic crawl (20000 clean frames across all six game modes,
deaths and game-over, with a positive control that bites); the idiomatic layer is at total 0; grounding is
complete with no debt; no grounded routine is left as `loc_` (the 6 renames are apt and grounded); audio
is de-grandfathered and ENFORCING with proven teeth, a valid sign-off, AND a now-green gate selftest; the
pixel `--done` bar passes on both layers with real tape-driven gameplay (0 frames over 5%); and the
whole-game (21) + equivalence (370) suites, comments, CA disasm, screenshot, browser, and all ROM shas are
green/verified. The one item this audit opened — the `audio_gate.py` selftest regression — is closed in
this same done-marker commit by a selftest-only fix that changes no gate verdict. frogger is DONE.
Proposer≠confirmer: this DONE.md's commit is re-audited in full by a SECOND independent agent via
