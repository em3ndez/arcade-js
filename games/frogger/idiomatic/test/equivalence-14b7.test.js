 * moveLaneObjectsAndCarryFrog — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x14B7.
 *
 * GATE: captured-entry + crafted variants. The lane-object mover runs only during GAMEPLAY (attract
 * never dispatches 0x14B7), so a coin/start tape drives the translated machine into play and a hook on
 * 0x14B7 clones the real top-level entry state on the first few gameplay frames, then throws to unwind
 * before the recursive translated engine's NMI re-entrancy overflows the JS stack. Each captured clone
 * has its frame/NMI boundaries at Infinity, so running the mover on it is bounded (no nested NMI).
 * The real entries populate the 11 lanes' control bytes, phase countdowns, sprite runs and lead
 * sprites from live play; crafted variants derived from a real base drive the frog-carry, ride-off,
 * mid-loop-entry, phase-countdown and 256-byte-run paths the stationary-frog captures do not reach.
 * Live-out is memory-only: the oracle's only stack use is one net `ret` (a pop, no write), the rewrite
 * is a for-loop, so RAM is byte-identical; the dead stack window [0x87E0,0x8800) is masked anyway.
 * Teeth: three broken RAM twins, plus a positive control that the carry path actually fires.
