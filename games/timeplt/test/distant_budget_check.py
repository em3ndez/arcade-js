"""A tape's `distant_budget_px` reaches the verdict, end to end, without MAME.

distant_budget.test.js runs this on every `npm test`. It drives the REAL distant_suite.distant_gate
-- the function main() calls after the MAME check -- and the REAL main() itself, from its command
line, from a schedule to a verdict, with only the external steps (MAME's -verifyroms, MAME's golden,
render.js's frames) replaced by synthetic dumps written to a temp dir: an all-black golden whose state dump enters the responded state partway in, and a JS render
identical to it except for a few consecutive distant-window frames carrying a known pixel count in
the band rows. The schedule-to-budget step is distant_suite.tape_budget, which the gate itself
calls; nothing here re-implements it.

Checking only that the key's VALUE is accepted (pixel_gate_required.py's selftest) cannot catch
the key being silently dropped between the schedule and the verdict: every tape would fall back
to the default budget and stay green. So each case asserts the VERDICT, and records the budget the
gate actually handed to rough_verdict and band_scan.

Prints one `[ok ]`/`[BAD]` line per assertion and exits non-zero on any BAD.
