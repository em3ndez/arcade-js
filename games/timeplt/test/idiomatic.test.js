// STANDING WHOLE-GAME GATE for Time Pilot (the file done_gate's check_wholegame globs and runs).
// It drives the WHOLE WIRED IDIOMATIC machine under the clock-free coroutine engine (runIdiomaticGame,
// NOT runFrames) from reset, through boot -> attract -> coin -> start -> real play, and asserts the
// whole-machine invariants a regression in any spine routine would break:
//   * boot completes the full frame budget with NO translation gap (stopError null, frames == budget);
//   * the coin banks a credit (COIN_ACCEPTED pulses, CREDIT_COUNT rises above its power-on value);
//   * play actually starts (PLAY_ACTIVE reaches its in-play 0xff -- the ONE cell that separates real
//     play from the attract demo, which runs the same round engine with the flag clear);
//   * gameplay ADVANCES (SEQUENCE_PHASE reaches the input-gated credit state 2, and the free-running
//     BCD frame counter takes many distinct values across the run);
//   * SP stays INERT: the vblank NMI is fired as a direct JS call (no guest push, no call/ret seam), so
//     neither the interrupt subtree nor any frame of the foreground moves the stack pointer. A layer
//     that still leans on a guest return slot -- an arm that returns through the interrupt's pushed
//     word -- walks SP up out of the stack and into sprite RAM, and this is where that shows.
//   * a LONG run stays placeable: attract and a driven session each run many thousands of NMIs, deep
//     enough that the era advances past the first two and the era-2+ object sweep runs -- the
//     time-accumulated paths the 600-ordinal arms never reach (runbook §4 "Driving coverage").
// Each live assertion carries a matching UNDRIVEN control (idle run): the coin never banks, play never
// starts, the credit state is never entered. That is what gives the gate teeth -- a mutant that clamps
// a cell to 0 fails the live arm; a mutant that pins it high unconditionally fails the idle arm.
//
// This is NOT the per-routine equivalence suite in games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/ (that compares the
// idiomatic layer against the translated oracle byte for byte). This gate asks a coarser, standing
// question: does the whole wired machine still boot and play? Skips cleanly when the ROM is absent (BYO).
