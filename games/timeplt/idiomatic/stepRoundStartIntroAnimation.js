/** stepRoundStartIntroAnimation — run one frame of the sub-step-14 band animation, and only on alternate frames. The
 * animation's own step cell picks the arm: the early steps flash the player ship and advance two character-plane
 * animations, the last step hides every sprite, sets up the active player's turn and reloads the inner
 * sequence index to its reload sub-step. LIVE-OUT: memory.
 *
 * ROM 0x1323-0x1366 (frozen lift translated/loc_1323.js). Grounding: [seen] in names.js.
 *
 * Role in the machine: this is the sub-step-14 arm of the sequence machine's phase-3 table at
 * 0x0F29 — the between-eras band animation that plays after a round is won and before the next
 * round starts. armRoundWonBandAnimationThenStepSequence stocks its control block (0xA9F0-0xA9F8)
 * and seeds INTRO_ANIMATION_STEP (0xA9F0) to 0; each sub-animation below writes the step it hands
 * off to when it finishes (flash->1, band-to-2->2, colour-cycle->3, band-to-4->4, flood->5), so this
 * routine only reads the step and never advances it itself. */
