/** parkSpritesAndArmLineWipeThenAdvanceSequence — one step of a screen-clearing sequence. Every sprite is parked out of sight; the
 * glyph and colour showing at one fixed character cell are copied into one fixed two-byte record;
 * the line wipe is armed to run from the plane's fifth line; and the sequence's inner index is
 * stepped on, which is the last thing done. Both the cell and the record are fixed here, so
 * nothing a caller was holding chooses either.
 *
 * ROM 0x181E-0x182F (frozen lift translated/loc_181e.js): three calls (0x15B6, 0x1AFC, 0x01B5) and a
 * tail jump to 0x0F1A. Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x181E).
 *
 * Role in the machine: step 0 of sequence phase 2 — "a credit on the board, waiting for start" —
 * run through dispatchSequencePhase2SubStepArm. Phase 2 is only ever entered with a credit banked,
 * and this first step clears the stage for the attract information screen: the sprites vanish at
 * once, and the character plane is then blanked one line per frame by the NEXT step
 * (blankOneLineThenGuardBlockOrDerailSequence), which consumes the wipe armed here (mechanisms.md,
 * "Phase 2").
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory. */
