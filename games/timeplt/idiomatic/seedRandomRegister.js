 * seedRandomRegister — copy a fixed seventeen-byte run of program space into the random register
 * block, then check the image that run came out of.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS: ROM routine 0x4B67 [seen]. RANDOM_REGISTER is the game's only entropy source, and its head
 * is written only by the generator's own feedback store and by this block copy. The copy is
 * unconditional and COMPLETE before the check runs, so nothing written here is gated by it.
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE: it runs at cold start (from initColdStartRamThenSeedConfig) and again at the
 * start of every attract demo, where FRAME_TICK has also just been zeroed -- so each demo begins from
 * identical generator state. A real game is not re-seeded; it inherits whatever
 * state the attract cycle left. A reader who takes the register as fixed from boot will be wrong.
 *
 * THE GUARD IS AN ANTI-TAMPER CHECK ON THE CREDIT LINE, NOT A CHECKSUM OF THE SEED: the two words it
 * reads (RANDOM_SEED_GUARD_WORD0 / RANDOM_SEED_GUARD_WORD1) sit in the middle of the copyright
 * caption's record -- its colour byte 0x10, the (c) glyph 0x30 and the K glyph 0x7C -- which with this
 * routine's own 0x44 come to zero exactly. The seed run is not read by the guard at all. A tampered
 * credit line therefore raises only AFTER the register has been seeded.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory -- the seventeen seed bytes -- plus the zero the guard total comes to (the ROM leaves
 * it in the accumulator).
