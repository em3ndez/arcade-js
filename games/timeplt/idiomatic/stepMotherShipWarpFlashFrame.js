/** stepMotherShipWarpFlashFrame — the misaligned entry to an object's warp/flash step, taken only as
 * an anti-tamper derail. It is reached on exactly two transfers, each behind a guard that a genuine
 * image always passes: a caption glyph read off the screen that is not the one a genuine image
 * paints there, and a tamper-witness pair that does not hold the values a genuine image plants and
 * copies into it. Entered here, the first instruction pops the caller's return slot as data, a
 * second pop follows one byte out of step, and every exit then returns through a slot read at an odd
 * offset from the frame — so control is destroyed rather than handed back. There is no faithful
 * transcription of that as a routine; the object's genuine warp/flash step is entered past this
 * prologue and lives elsewhere. So this raises where the derail would begin.
 * LIVE-OUT: none — it never returns. */
