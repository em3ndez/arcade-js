/** drawCaptionInPenColour — paint the caption a caller's index selects. A table of pointers turns
 * the index into a record; the record opens with the character cell the caption starts at and one
 * more byte, and the glyphs follow. That third byte is STEPPED OVER, not used: the colour every
 * cell gets is the low half of the current colour cell instead, so a caption's own record cannot
 * choose its colour.
 *
 * ROM 0x0C0F-0x0C21. Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x0C0F).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. This is command 2's handler in the command ring ("caption in pen colour",
 * mechanisms.md §8): a sequence arm posts (2, caption index) and the foreground drain loop
 * dispatches it here through the handler table at 0x0BBC. The colour cell is PEN_COLOUR 0xAD0C
 * [seen], the active player's pen colour, which the era pen table sets to the era number plus
 * one -- so captions drawn this way (PLAYER n and READY at round start, and the flashing era year
 * on its command-2 frames; GAME OVER is posted as command 10, the +5 sibling) change colour from
 * era to era. It is the +0 member of the caption family; drawTextRunByIndex is the
 * sibling that reads the byte this one steps over, which is what shows that byte is the record's
 * own colour (names.js).
 * PARAMETER: index = the caption number, the ring command's argument (the ROM's A).
 * LIVE-OUT: the cells painted, plus the cursor the painter leaves standing; the colour used is
 * also returned (left in C). */
