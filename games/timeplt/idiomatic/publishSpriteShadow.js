/**
 * publishSpriteShadow — publish the sprite shadow into the two hardware banks. Each bank is gathered from three runs of the
 * shadow, in an order that is not the order they sit in memory, into one continuous forty-eight-byte block, and each
 * byte passes through a transform chosen by TWO things: which half of its two-byte sprite it is, and which way round
 * the cabinet has the picture. Three of the four bank-and-orientation pairs transform one half and pass the other
 * through; the fourth transforms both halves, differently. Every transform is byte-wide, so all of them wrap.
 *
 * Afterwards, and only inside one window of the sequence machine, eight of the twenty-four sprites have the top bit
 * of both their bytes raised — and only where the second half's is still clear, so a second pass changes nothing.
 * LIVE-OUT: memory.
 *
 * ROM: 0x0365. Tag [seen] (names.js). Role in the machine: the game never draws into the sprite hardware
 * while it works — every handler writes the sprite shadow at 0xAA10-0xAA6F — and once a frame, first thing
 * in the vertical-blank service, this routine copies that shadow into hardware bank 0 at SPRITE_BANK0_BASE
 * 0xB010 (X and shape bytes) and bank 1 at SPRITE_BANK1_BASE 0xB410 (attribute and Y bytes), twenty-four
 * sprites each. Which way round the picture is comes from SCREEN_UNFLIPPED 0xA987 [seen]; the vertical-blank
 * service rewrites that cell only after this publish, so each frame's sprites use the previous frame's
 * orientation (mechanisms.md, "Publishing the shadow to the sprite banks").
