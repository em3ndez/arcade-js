 * awardBonusLifeAtScoreMark — award an extra life when the active player's score reaches a bonus mark,
 * once per mark.
 *
 * ROM 0x4DDE-0x4E1A. Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x4DDE).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. Called once per pass of the round engine's service list
 * (serviceRoundThenResolvePlayerState), and does nothing unless PLAY_ACTIVE (0xAD30) [seen] is set, so the
 * attract demo never earns lives.
 *
 * HOW A MARK IS RECOGNISED. Scores are packed decimal, three bytes per player; only the TOP byte (0xAD35 for
 * player one, 0xAD38 for player two, chosen by ACTIVE_PLAYER [seen]) is compared, and it must EQUAL an entry
 * of the mark list — the ROM searches with `cpir`, which only finds exact matches. Which list applies is set
 * by bit 0 of BONUS_LIFE_SETTING (0xA9C3): the list at ROM 0x4E1B when clear, 0x4E30 when set. Each list
 * starts with a length byte followed by the marks.
 *
 * WHY A LATCH. The top byte stays at a mark value for many passes after the score reaches it, so bit 0 of
 * BONUS_LIFE_LATCH (0xAD03) [seen] makes the award one-shot: a match while the bit is set does nothing, and
 * the first pass whose top byte matches no mark clears it again.
 *
 * THE AWARD increments LIVES_REMAINING (0xAD00) [seen], posts ring command 5 carrying the count from BEFORE
 * the increment, and tail-jumps into requestBonusLifeSound (ROM 0x5805).
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory.
