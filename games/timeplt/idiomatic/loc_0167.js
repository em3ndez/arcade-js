 * the frame unwinding one word out of step, and return to a value that is not an address — control
 * destroyed rather than reported. So the mismatch arm has no faithful transcription as a routine:
 * raise where it would land instead of transcribing junk. Reaching this is a tampered-image derail;
 * on a genuine image it is dead. */
