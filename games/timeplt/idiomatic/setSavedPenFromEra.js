/** setSavedPenFromEra — seed the pen (glyph and colour) that the active player's SAVED context block
 * will hand back, from the two-byte record the era in that same block selects out of a ROM table.
 *
 * ROLE. Each player has a sixteen-byte saved context block (player one at 0xAD10, player two at
 * 0xAD20) that mirrors the live block at 0xAD00; when a player comes up, the context load (the
 * sixteen-byte copy at 0x4C8A) copies that block into the live one. This routine writes only the
 * pen pair of the saved block (+0x0B glyph, +0x0C colour), so the pen takes effect the next time
 * that player's context is loaded -- the live pen is left alone. That is what separates it from
 * seatCaptionPenFromEraFoldingTamperIntoPhase (0x335E), which also sets the live pen.
 *
 * Which player is read from and written to is the same choice, made once from ACTIVE_PLAYER
 * (0 = player one, 1 = player two), so the era read and the pen written can never cross blocks.
 * The era index is doubled as a byte before it reaches the table (the Z80 `add a,a`), so an index
 * past the half-way mark would fold back to the head of the table.
 *
 * ROM 0x339C-0x33B7 (frozen lift translated/loc_339c.js). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES
 * 0x339c). LIVE-OUT: the two bytes written into the active player's saved pen pair.
