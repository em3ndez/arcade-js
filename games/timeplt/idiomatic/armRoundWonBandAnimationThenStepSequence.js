 * armRoundWonBandAnimationThenStepSequence — ROM 0x4A0F [seen]
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. The set-up for the between-eras band animation a won round plays (the time-warp
 * effect before the next era begins). It is sequence sub-step 13 of the round engine; the
 * animation itself is then run frame by frame by stepRoundStartIntroAnimation, which dispatches on
 * INTRO_ANIMATION_STEP.
 *
 * ROLE. It stocks the animation's eight-byte control block (the step seed, the flash tick, the two
 * band pass countdowns, the colour-cycle and colour-flood countdowns and the band script's start),
 * lays the band's backing picture along the first row of the character plane, colours the band's
 * rows and stub cells by adding the pen colour to fixed offsets, seeds the active player's saved
 * pen from its era, and tail-steps the sequence sub-step.
 *
 * HARDWARE. The character (tilemap) RAM has two planes 0x400 apart: the tile codes at 0xA400-0xA7FF
 * and their colour attributes at 0xA000-0xA3FF. The ROM addresses a colour cell by taking the
 * tile cell's address and clearing bit 10 (`res 2,h`), which is what toColour does. One row of the
 * plane is 32 cells, so ROW_STEP (-32) moves one row up the address space.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: the block, the backing row, the coloured cells, the saved pen and the sub-step cell;
 * no register is live-out.
