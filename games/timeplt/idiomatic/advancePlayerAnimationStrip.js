/** advancePlayerAnimationStrip — advance a multi-frame tile animation driven by a phase byte in the record. On the
 * opening frame (phase at or past the cap) the phase is clamped, the paired entry is flagged, and
 * sound cues are requested — one burst always, one extra from ERA_INDEX 2 up — and then two
 * game-state cells may divert the frame into the tamper trap instead. Otherwise the phase is stepped
 * down and, when it lands on one of seven keyframe values, a shape strip is blitted tile-by-tile
 * into video and colour memory a row at a time; a phase between keyframes draws nothing.
 * LIVE-OUT: memory. The routine is a pure painter — its sole caller (dispatchPlayerFrameByState)
 * tail-returns and reads no register it leaves, so every register it touches is dead-after-return
 * scratch and lives here as a JS local. The two diverts land on the tamper trap, which reads
 * nothing: a good image never takes them, so nothing is handed to it. */

// ROM 0x2010-0x20AE (lift: translated/loc_2010.js). Grounding tag in names.js ROUTINES: [seen].
//
// ROLE IN THE MACHINE. This is the player ship's EXPLOSION (mechanisms.md, "The explosion"). A kill
// stores 0xF0 into PLAYER_STATE, the player record's head byte; from the next frame on,
// dispatchPlayerFrameByState (0x1EDF) sends any player state other than 0 or 0xFF here, with IX on
// the player record (0xA800) and IY on its sprite entry (0xAA10). The routine uses that state byte
// itself as its countdown:
//   * opening frame (0xB4 or more): clamp to 0xB4, hide the ship's sprite, request the opening-frame
//     sound cues (which sounds they are is unidentified, mechanisms.md), and check two anti-tamper
//     witnesses;
//   * every frame: count down by one, and on seven keyframe values paint a 6-row by 5-cell block of
//     character tiles over the ship's pinned screen position -- a fireball drawn in the background
//     plane, growing and then shrinking;
//   * between keyframes nothing is drawn; the count runs on silently until the round engine sees it
//     reach zero and takes a life (that is not done here).
//
// PARAMETERS. `ix` is the player record, `iy` the player's sprite entry; both are seated by the caller.
//
// LIVE-OUT: memory only -- PLAYER_STATE, the sprite-code byte, the sound requests, and the painted
// character and colour cells.
