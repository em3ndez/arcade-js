 * unpackTheFirstThreeSwitchSettings — open the settings block: store the lives count whole, peel the
 * next two switch bits into a cell each, and hand the rest of the switch byte on.
 *
 * ROM 0x2E19-0x2E30 (ends `jp 0x49A8`). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x2E19).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. One link of the power-on chain that turns the gameplay DIP-switch bank
 * (DSW1, read at 0xC200) into settings cells, once at boot. The caller, seedGameConfigFromDipSwitches
 * [seen], has already read the bank, complemented it (the switches are active-low) and turned its low
 * two bits into a lives count. This routine takes the next two bits; finishBootSelfTestAndColdStart
 * [seen], which it jumps into, takes bits 4-7. Between the three of them every bit of the bank lands
 * in a cell:
 *   bits 0-1 -> STARTING_LIVES (0xA9C1) [code]      (here, as the caller's count)
 *   bit 2    -> COCKTAIL_MODE (0xA9C2) [code]       (here)
 *   bit 3    -> BONUS_LIFE_SETTING (0xA9C3) [code]  (here)
 *   bits 4-6 -> DIFFICULTY_SETTING, bit 7 -> DEMO_SOUNDS_ENABLE (the continuation)
 *
 * PARAMETERS. `whole` is the lives count the caller worked out (3, 4, 5, or 0xFF for the setting that
 * would compute 6). `packed` is the whole complemented switch byte.
 *
 * Nothing is read from memory. Control tail-transfers into the continuation and never comes back.
 * LIVE-OUT: the three settings cells, and everything the continuation does.
