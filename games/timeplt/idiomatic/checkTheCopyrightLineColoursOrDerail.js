/** checkTheCopyrightLineColoursOrDerail — read the colour of thirteen cells along one line and derail if any of them has been
 * changed. It starts at the caption's own first cell and follows it in the same direction the
 * caption is painted, a fixed stride each time; every cell must hold one of exactly two colours —
 * the two the caption's line is painted and flashed in, so on a genuine image the walk always comes
 * out clean. The first cell holding anything else ends the walk on a transfer into a caption record
 * that merely decodes as instructions: it steps the stack pointer by one and pops misaligned words,
 * so the frame unwinds out of step and control is destroyed rather than reported. That arm has no faithful
 * transcription as a routine, so it raises where the transfer would land. Thirteen good cells
 * simply return: neither caller's continuing path reads what the walk leaves in its registers -- each
 * reloads the accumulator, pointer, stride and flags before use and neither reads the count -- so
 * all of it dies here. LIVE-OUT: memory only (nothing on the clean exit).
 *
 * ROM 0x19DA-0x19EF (frozen lift translated/loc_19da.js). Grounding: [seen].
 *
 * Role in the machine: an anti-tamper check on the copyright caption. Two static call sites reach
 * it (`call 0x19da` at 0x176A and at 0x1797), from holdCopyrightThenVerifyGlyphAndSeatWitnessOrDerail
 * and paintReadoutsThenSampleWitnessOrDerail.
 *
 * Why these cells and these two colours (names.js "why"): the copyright line's record, reached
 * through the caption table at 0x0C50 (first word 0x086B), paints thirteen glyphs from 0xA6BC with a
 * -32 cursor step, so its colour twins (address & ~0x0400) are 0xA2BC, 0xA29C ... 0xA13C -- the
 * cells walked here. The line has TWO records carrying the same destination and glyphs and differing
 * only in the colour byte: 0x10 in the record at 0x086B and 0x05 in the record at 0x4900. Those are
 * exactly the two accepted values, so a genuine line in either state passes.
 *
 * The derail target 0x49FA is CAPTION RECORD 4 -- destination 0xA6EE,
 * colour 0x14, seventeen glyphs and a 0xB9 terminator at 0x4A0E -- text, not a routine. */
