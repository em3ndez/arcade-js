/** loseLifeAndHandOver — one maintenance step per call: hide the sprite band, start the next round when a
 * flag is set, and queue this frame's fixed sound requests. Then decrement the lives count at the
 * head of the live 16-byte context block and copy that block into whichever of two save slots the
 * active-player selector points at. If lives reached zero, hand off to the game-over banner and
 * stop. Otherwise, when the other player's slot still shows lives, flip the selector, then stamp a
 * constant into one cell and a program-image byte into another.
 *
 * ROM 0x11ED-0x123A (lift: translated/loc_11ed.js). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x11ED).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. This is what happens after the player's ship has died. The round engine
 * (serviceRoundThenResolvePlayerState) calls it as soon as PLAYER_STATE reads 0, i.e. the dying
 * sequence is over (mechanisms.md, "loseLifeAndHandOver runs as soon as PLAYER_STATE reads 0").
 * The "constant" and "program-image byte" above are the sequence machine's delay (90 frames) and
 * its sub-step (HANDOVER_SUBSTEP_SEED, which reads 1), so the next life -- or the other player's
 * turn -- re-enters the sequence at step 1 after a short pause.
 *
 * The context block: each player's per-life state (lives, pen, ...) lives in a sixteen-byte block.
 * The LIVE copy is at 0xAD00 (LIVES_REMAINING [seen] is its first byte); player one's saved copy
 * is at 0xAD10 (PLAYER_ONE_LIVES [seen]) and player two's at 0xAD20 (PLAYER_TWO_LIVES [seen]).
 * ACTIVE_PLAYER 0xAD32 [seen] (0 or 1) says which save block is the live player's.
 * LIVE-OUT: memory. */
