// The name is kept as hex on purpose: names.js records that no absolute reference to 0x3793 exists

// ROLE IN THE MACHINE. It is the "no kills owed" arm of the enemy-craft spawner. Once KILLS_REMAINING
// reaches zero the spawner stops sizing its search by the round's craft count and instead walks a fixed
// run of five slots. names.js records spawnEnemyCraftWhenBandUnderTwo (0x379F) transferring here when
// KILLS_REMAINING is zero; gateTheFreeSlotSearchAndPickItsRun stages the same run inline.
//
// It reads nothing and writes nothing itself: all three values are constants chosen here, and control
// does not come back. LIVE-OUT: memory only -- whatever slot the search fills.
