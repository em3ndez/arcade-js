 * runOneShotAnimatedObjectSlot — ROM 0x406C [seen]
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. The per-frame handler for an object slot whose head byte is running a one-shot
 * countdown (any value other than 0 = empty and 0xFF = flying). The slot bank sweeps
 * (sweepObjectSlotBankByHead, sweepObjectSlotBankServicingFirstSlot) hand it one slot at a time: a
 * state record, whose byte +0 is the counter, and the sprite entry that puts it on screen.
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. The countdown is an animation that plays once and then removes the object
 * (mechanisms.md, object banks): a counter of 60 or more is re-stamped down to 59 once (with a
 * sound request), then the counter drops by one a frame; while it is 28 or more the object is shown
 * with a shape from ONE_SHOT_OBJECT_SHAPE_TABLE (0x4094), and when it reaches zero the slot is cleared.
 * Between those the object drifts with the world scroll, so it keeps its place in the world while
 * the view scrolls under the player's ship. The expiry arm is the ROM block at 0x40AB, the same three stores as retireSlot.
 *
 * PARAMETERS: `object` = the slot's state record (the ROM's IX), `sprite` = its sprite entry (IY).
 * LIVE-OUT: memory only.
