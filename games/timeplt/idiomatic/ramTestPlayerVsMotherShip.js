/** ramTestPlayerVsMotherShip — pick the collision box for the mutual kill of the player and one fixed two-slot
 * target by the era, then run it. In two of the eras the wider first-axis box applies and control
 * transfers to that check; in the rest the same destruction runs here with a narrower first-axis
 * box. Both things must be live and their coordinates must fall inside the box; when they do, both
 * take the destroyed code, the Mother-Ship's remaining-hit count is cleared, and the chained hit
 * score is posted. Any one test failing leaves everything untouched. LIVE-OUT: memory.
 *
 * ROM 0x50B1-0x50ED. Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x50b1).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. This is the "ramming" test between the player's ship and the Mother-Ship,
 * the large two-slot boss craft whose record starts at MOTHER_SHIP_STATE 0xA8A0 [seen]. The
 * round engine's collision pass reaches it through splitCollisionWorkByFrameParity and
 * runAllCollisionSweepsThisFrame, only while the Mother-Ship is armed (names.js 0x4ebc). A touch
 * kills both: the player loses a life and the Mother-Ship is destroyed outright rather than
 * losing one of its hits, because MOTHER_SHIP_HOLD_COUNTER 0xA8A4 [seen] -- the hits it can still
 * absorb -- is zeroed here.
 *
 * THE BOX. Every collision test in this game compares two sprite entries' whole-part coordinates
 * on the board's two native axes (the entry's +0x00 byte and its +0x31 byte) as a wrapped byte
 * difference. Adding a "reach" to the difference and requiring the result to be below a "span"
 * accepts differences from -reach up to span-reach-1, so the box can be lopsided.
