/**
 * destroyPlayerAndMotherShipOnContact — ROM 0x50EE [seen]
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. The ramming test between the player's ship and the Mother-Ship: flying into it
 * destroys both. Its caller ramTestPlayerVsMotherShip selects this arm in eras 0 and 4 because its
 * first-axis window is the wider of the two; the other eras run the same destruction inline with a
 * narrower window.
 *
 * ROLE. Both must be live (PLAYER_STATE 0xA800, MOTHER_SHIP_STATE 0xA8A0) and their coordinates
 * must fall inside a box around the Mother-Ship: -8..+8 on the first axis and an off-centre -25..+9
 * on the second. When it holds, both state bytes take the destroyed code, the Mother-Ship's
 * remaining-hit count at record +4 (MOTHER_SHIP_HOLD_COUNTER 0xA8A4) is zeroed so the contact
 * destroys it outright instead of costing it one of the hits it can absorb (the arming path seeds
 * seven), and the chained
 * hit score is posted -- reached by transfer, not call, so that routine's return carries it. Any
 * of the four tests failing leaves all untouched.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory.
