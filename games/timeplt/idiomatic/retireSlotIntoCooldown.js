/**
 * retireSlotIntoCooldown — take an object out of play, then arm the record's delay byte instead of
 * leaving it clear, so the slot is held rather than freed.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS: ROM routine 0x48AD [seen]. The record's occupancy byte and both of the sprite entry's
 * coordinate bytes go to zero -- which is retireSlot's body byte for byte, and the whole of taking the
 * object out of play -- and then record offset 14 is loaded with 0xF0.
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE: that offset-14 byte is a cooldown, not scratch. Elsewhere the per-slot handler
 * tests it and, while it is non-zero, diverts the whole slot to the routine that counts it down; two
 * routines decrement it. So the slot is not free the instant it is emptied. The arming is the entire
 * difference from retireSlot. retireObjectAndHold arms the same byte with 0x80 and
 * retireEntryPairIntoCooldown with 95; how long any of these lasts depends on the countdown's tick rate,
 * which nothing here fixes. Both bases are parameters, so WHICH slot goes out is the caller's.
 *
 * PARAMETERS: `record` is the object's state record (the ROM passes it in IX), `entry` its sprite entry
 * (IY). LIVE-OUT: memory only -- four bytes.
