/**
 * enqueueTransitionSoundBurst — queue seven sound requests back to back.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS: ROM 0x5634-0x565E, tag [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x5634). The sound side of the game is
 * fed through a small queue of sound codes; this routine drops seven codes into it in one go. Six of the
 * codes are fixed, but none of them is written into the instructions as an immediate value: each is
 * FETCHED from its own byte of the program image (`ld a,(addr)`), so an edit to the image changes what
 * is asked for. The seventh is formed by adding the era index to a fixed base, so it is the one request
 * that differs from era to era.
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE: the burst of sounds that marks a transition. The initials-entry arm of the
 * sequence machine, for example, "queues the transition sounds" when it finishes (names.js, the
 * high-score initials role). Every code goes through enqueueSoundUnconditional (0x5628), the way into the
 * sound queue that does NOT test whether a game is being played -- so nothing here asks that question
 * either, and the burst is queued in the attract demo just as in play.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory-only (the sound queue and its count).
