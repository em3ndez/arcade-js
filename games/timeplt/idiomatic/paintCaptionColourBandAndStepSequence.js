/** paintCaptionColourBandAndStepSequence — paint a caption's colour band from a base colour. Starting at the cursor the caller
 * leaves in HL it lays the caller's A over one cell, then a run of the caller's C, then a short
 * fixed tail; next it reads the base colour and fills two colour-RAM rows and six scattered colour
 * cells, every value the base plus a fixed offset. Last it seeds the saved pen from the era and
 * steps the sequence sub-step. LIVE-OUT: the cells written; A, C, HL and DE are left as scratch.
 *
 * ROM 0x4A42-0x4A9C (frozen lift translated/loc_4a42.js). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x4a42).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. This is the second half of the round-won band animation. names.js and
 * mechanisms.md record that on a genuine image the body runs only as the fall-through of
 * armRoundWonBandAnimationThenStepSequence, which seats the lead byte (A), the body byte (C) and
 * the cursor (HL) before arriving here; its own entry point is reached only by a tamper derail.
 *
 * HARDWARE BACKGROUND. The character plane is two parallel RAMs: tile codes in video RAM and a
 * colour attribute per cell in colour RAM, 0x400 bytes lower. Clearing bit 2 of the high address
 * byte (the ROM's `res 2,h`) folds a video-RAM address onto the same cell's colour byte — so each
 * colour address below is the colour-plane twin of a character-plane cell (names.js). A tilemap
 * row is 32 bytes; the board is ROT90, so one row back in memory (ROW) is one cell along a
 * displayed line.
 *
 * `head` is the ROM's A (the lead byte), `body` its C (the run byte) and `hl` its HL (the cursor,
 * one cell before where writing starts).
