/** clearWorkRamAndSpriteBanksThenColdInit — cold-start clear: kick the watchdog, wipe two sprite-bank runs and the whole 2 KB of
 * work RAM, then fold a fixed program run into one total; anything but a genuine image's total runs
 * the frame service out of band, and either way it hands off to the screen-RAM clear and verify.
 * LIVE-OUT: memory.
 *
 * ROM 0x0069-0x00A7, reached once at boot from 0x07B1. [seen]
 *
 * Role in the machine: the second stage of the cold start. RAM powers up holding garbage, so every
 * sprite and work cell is zeroed here before anything reads it. It ends with one of the game's
 * anti-tamper checks, which on a patched image does not halt but quietly runs a whole frame service
 * early -- corruption rather than a clean refusal (names.js, saveAccumulatorForFrameInterrupt).
