/** seatMotherShipSlotThenDispatchByEraUnlessArmed — put one object record, and the sprite entry that shows it, in front of the era-keyed
 * per-slot handler, unless the Mother-Ship is up: while it is nothing here runs at all. The handler
 * is reached as a transfer, so it returns past here and nothing here runs after it.
 * LIVE-OUT: memory, and whatever the handler leaves behind.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS: the per-slot entry for slot 5 of the seven-slot enemy-craft band (records at 0xA850,
 * stride 0x10, paired with sprite entries at 0xAA1A, stride 0x02). Slot 5 is the Mother-Ship's slot:
 * record MOTHER_SHIP_STATE (0xA8A0) with sprite entry MOTHER_SHIP_ENTRY (0xAA24).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE: stepSevenCraftSlots (0x28A1) runs slots 0-4, then this entry, then slot 6
 * (mechanisms.md). Before the boss arrives this record is just one more craft slot and gets the
 * ordinary era handler like the others. Once armed, the Mother-Ship occupies this record AND slot 6's
 * and is driven by armMotherShipOrStep instead, so this entry and its twin
 * seatCraftSlot6ThenDispatchByEraUnlessArmed return at once while MOTHER_SHIP_ARMED is set.
 *
 * ROM: 0x28EE (0x28EE-0x28FD), frozen lift translated/loc_28ee.js. Grounding tag: [seen] (names.js).
