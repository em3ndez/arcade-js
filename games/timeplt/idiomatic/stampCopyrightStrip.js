/** stampCopyrightStrip — park the four pieces of one fixed caption strip in the display list.
 * Four consecutive object entries are filled entirely from constants: a shared position on one
 * axis and a shared control byte, shapes counting up from the first, and positions on the other
 * axis stepping one piece-width apart so the pieces butt together into a single strip. Each
 * entry is split across two halves a fixed distance apart, which is why every piece takes two
 * writes on each side. Nothing is read and nothing branches, so the same sixteen bytes land on
 * every call and a second call changes nothing the first did not.
 *
 * ROM 0x0B06-0x0B2A (frozen lift translated/loc_0b06.js). Grounding: [seen].
 *
 * Role in the machine: the strip is the copyright caption drawn in sprites — the shapes it places
 * decode out of the sprite ROM as a copyright mark and then KO, NA, MI. The attract sequence's
 * title and copyright steps call it, and re-stamp it every frame while they hold the copyright
 * screen (mechanisms.md, phase 1 and the credit-wait steps). When a game begins,
 * hideCaptionSprites zeroes the vertical byte of exactly these four entries to park them off
 * screen.
 *
 * ★ This routine's own code bytes are also data: guardBlockOrBlankDisplay folds 51 bytes starting
 * at 0x0B06 (stampCopyrightStrip_ADDR) onto COPYRIGHT_STRIP_CHECK_SEED as an anti-tamper checksum,
 * and blanks the display if the total is wrong — so a patched copyright strip turns the picture
 * off.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory only. */
