/** startGameOnFreePlay — start a game for whichever start button the input mirror shows held --
 * two players if the two-player bit is set, one if only the one-player bit is -- stocking each
 * started player's block with the lives setting, and charging no credit.
 *
 * ROLE. On a free-play cabinet no coin is needed, so the start buttons alone begin a game. All
 * three callers test the FREE_PLAY cell before tail-jumping here, which is why this path takes no
 * credit (the coin path, startTwoPlayerGame, subtracts two in packed BCD). With neither button
 * held it does nothing at all. The two-player button wins outright: it is tested first and its arm
 * never looks at the one-player bit. Both arms raise PLAY_ACTIVE and stock player one's lives from
 * STARTING_LIVES (the DIP lives setting); the two-player arm also raises TWO_PLAYER_GAME and stocks
 * player two, where the one-player arm clears both of those -- player two's zero lives is what
 * later makes a hand-over impossible in a one-player game. Either arm then hands over to
 * seatSequencePhase3AndResetSubStep (ROM 0x172A), which seats the sequence machine at its last
 * outer phase, phase 3, with the sub-step at zero -- the phase in which the round engine runs.
 *
 * ROM 0x1690-0x16AE and 0x1719-0x1729 (frozen lift translated/loc_1690.js; the one-player arm lives
 * at 0x1719). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x1690). LIVE-OUT: memory.
