 * askForSoundWhileTheGroupIsClear — from the third era on, ask for one sound every thirty-second frame,

 * the entry having done nothing at all.
 *
 * ROM 0x40B8-0x40D5. Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x40B8).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. One entry of the round engine's service list (serviceRoundThenResolvePlayerState),
 * so it is consulted on every pass of the round engine. It sits immediately before the routine that walks
 * the same group of records from 0xA8C0 and carries the same era test (names.js "why"), so the pair is
 * one subsystem's motion and one subsystem's sound.
 *
 * The three records are the per-era special-object bank at ERA_OBJECT_RECORD_SLOT0 (0xA8C0) [seen], 0xA8D0
 * and 0xA8E0; a record's first byte is its state byte, and 0xFF there means the object is live.
 *
 * WHICH SOUND is not established: the code byte asked for is ROM[0x07FE] = 0x86 (names.js "why"), requested
 * through requestLateEraProgressSound, which admits it only while a game is being played. Under MAME the
 * gate is the conjunction of every test (names.js "why": passes and refusals counted at the entry).
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory, through the request.
