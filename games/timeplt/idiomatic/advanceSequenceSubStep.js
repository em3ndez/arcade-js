 * advanceSequenceSubStep — step the sequence machine's inner index on by one.
 *
 * ROM 0x0F1A-0x0F1E (loc_0f1a). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x0F1A).
 *
 * What it is: the "next step" move of the two-level sequence machine. SEQUENCE_SUBSTEP (0xA9AC)
 * [seen] is the INNER index: each mode's dispatcher reads it (the round engine masks it to its low
 * nibble) and jumps through a word table to the arm it selects. An arm that has finished its job
 * comes here so that the next frame's dispatch runs the following arm.
 *
 * Role in the machine: callers reach it as a tail jump, so the caller's own return is carried by
 * this one. It is the inner half of the pair whose outer half is advanceSequencePhase, which
 * steps the phase and zeroes this index in one breath — so this step is the one that gets
 * discarded whenever the sequence really changes mode.
 *
 * It clamps nothing, masks nothing, branches nowhere and returns nothing.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: SEQUENCE_SUBSTEP alone.
