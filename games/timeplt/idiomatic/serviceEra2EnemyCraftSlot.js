/** serviceEra2EnemyCraftSlot — run one object slot, dispatched on its state byte (ix+0): the empty value does
 * nothing; the active value flies it — steered toward its aim three frames in four, moved at the
 * slow speed, retired once it reaches a retire line, else its sprite is dressed and two launch
 * attempts run; the held value releases it; any other value steps its dying state. LIVE-OUT: memory. */

/*
 * ROM 0x2984-0x29AF, grounding [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x2984).
 *
 * ROLE. Word 2 of the era table at 0x2914 that dispatchSeatedSlotByEraIndex runs when ERA_INDEX's low
 * three bits are 2 -- the third era (A.D. 1970, helicopters, in gameplay.md). Called once per frame
 * per seated enemy-craft slot; it does that slot's whole frame of work. It has the same skeleton as
 * the other era services and differs from era 0 in two places: steering is skipped one frame in
 * four, and the sprite is dressed by dressSpriteForFineHeading instead of refreshSpriteFromHeading.
 *
 * PARAMETERS. `ix` is the slot's 16-byte object record (state byte at +0); `iy` is the slot's
 * two-byte sprite entry -- named for the Z80 index registers the ROM carries them in; the defaults
 * read those registers for a caller that still seats them there.
 *
 * THE STATE BYTE (record +0). 0x00 empty; 0xFF active; 0xFE held (waiting out a release delay); any
 * other value a dying object's countdown. Decoded in the ROM by `and a`, `inc a`, `inc a`.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory only.
