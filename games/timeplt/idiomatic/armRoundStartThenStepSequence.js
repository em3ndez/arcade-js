/**
 * armRoundStartThenStepSequence — the sequence arm that sets up a game before its first round: seat both
 * players' saved context blocks to their starting values, then prepare either a credited game or an
 * attract-demo round, and step the sequence on.
 *
 * ROM 0x27B1-0x28A0. Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x27B1).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. An arm of the round-engine phase's sub-step table, dispatched by
 * dispatchSequenceSubStepArm; it runs once and tail-steps SEQUENCE_SUBSTEP [seen]. Each player's state
 * lives in a sixteen-byte saved context block — player one at 0xAD10, player two at 0xAD20 — which is
 * copied into the live block at 0xAD00 when that player's turn starts. This arm writes the PLAYER_ONE_*
 * / PLAYER_TWO_* copies, so every value lands for both players at once.
 *
 * THE SPLIT on PLAY_ACTIVE (0xAD30) [seen], set for the whole of a credited game and clear otherwise:
 *   - SET — a real game: clear both scores, post ring command 4, load the difficulty record the
 *     cabinet's Difficulty DIP selects (names.js DIFFICULTY_SETTING [seen]: read "at exactly one place:
 *     the credited-game init", which is this arm), and arm SEQUENCE_DELAY with 0x96.
 *   - CLEAR — an attract-demo round: pick the demo's era from the cycling ATTRACT_STAGE_COUNTER, zero
 *     two frame counters and the demo-script round-robin index, reseed the random register, wipe the
 *     player-shot and object-state RAM,
 *     load difficulty record 2, and arm SEQUENCE_DELAY with 0x5A.
 * Each arm also runs one anti-tamper fold over 256 program bytes (see the steps below).
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory (registers and the dead stack scratch aside).
