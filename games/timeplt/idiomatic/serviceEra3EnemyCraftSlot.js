/** serviceEra3EnemyCraftSlot — the era-3 step for one object slot, dispatched on the slot's lifecycle byte at ix+0:
 * an idle slot does nothing; a live slot (0xff) is steered and flown a step, then either retired at
 * the line or given a bank launch, dressed and given a spawn attempt; 0xfe releases a held slot; a lower value is a death
 * countdown step. LIVE-OUT: memory. */

/*
 * ROM 0x29B0-0x29D4, grounding [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x29b0).
 *
 * ROLE. Word 3 of the era table at 0x2914 that dispatchSeatedSlotByEraIndex runs when ERA_INDEX's low
 * three bits are 3 -- the fourth era (A.D. 1982/83, jet fighters, in gameplay.md, whose enemies are
 * "as fast and manoeuvrable as you"). Called once per frame per seated enemy-craft slot. Same
 * skeleton as the other era services; this era flies its craft with flyAtFastestSpeed and draws
 * them with dressSpriteForCoarseHeading.
 *
 * The body below runs, for a live slot, in the ROM's call order at 0x29BF-0x29D4: steer, fly,
 * retire test, bank launch, dress the sprite, attacker launch.
 *
 * PARAMETERS. `ix` is the slot's 16-byte object record (lifecycle byte at +0); `iy` is its two-byte
 * sprite entry -- named for the Z80 index registers the ROM carries them in; the defaults read those
 * registers for a caller that still seats them there.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory only.
