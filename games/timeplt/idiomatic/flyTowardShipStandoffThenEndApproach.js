 * flyTowardShipStandoffThenEndApproach — run one chased object through a frame of its approach.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS: ROM 0x41B8-0x41EB, tag [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x41b8). On every sixteenth frame it
 * re-aims the object at one of two fixed standoff points near the ship, a bit in the object's record
 * choosing which; if the object has by then arrived at that point it cuts the record's approach
 * countdown to zero, so the record's handler takes its expired arm next frame. Then, every frame, it
 * turns the object toward its aim, moves it and dresses its sprite, and finally asks whether it has
 * reached a retire line.
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE: an era-4 path only -- the one route in requires ERA_INDEX to be 4 (names.js "why"
 * for endApproachNow, which this routine alone calls); under MAME every dispatch of endApproachNow had
 * the record at 0xA8C0. The two standoff points (ENEMY_STANDOFF_AIM_SET / _CLEAR) stand off
 * the ship rather than sitting on it: the object closes in on a point near the ship, not on the ship.
 *
 * Arguments: `ix` is the object's record (the ROM's IX), `iy` its sprite entry (the ROM's IY).
 * LIVE-OUT: memory; whether the object reached a retire line is returned (the ROM's carry).
