/** loc_58b6 — fly one object a step at twice the velocity one fixed table of samples sets, the
 * shared drift added once; choosing that table is all this entry does. LIVE-OUT: memory.
 *
 * ROM 0x58B6-0x58BB (frozen lift translated/loc_58b6.js: `ld hl,0x5e00 / jp 0x58fe`).
 * Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x58b6).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. flyAlongHeadingAtDoubleVelocity (0x58FE) is the fast mover: it reads the
 * heading out of the object's record, looks up two perpendicular velocity components in whatever
 * table it is handed, and adds TWICE each component plus the world scroll once to the object's
 * two coordinates. It does not choose a table itself; it is entered only through two-instruction
 * shims like this one, each of which seats a table address and tail-jumps in. That choice of
 * table is the whole of what this entry contributes — the object record and sprite entry come
 * straight through from the caller.
 *
 * The table seated here is OPENING_ERA_VELOCITY_TABLE (0x5E00), the ROM velocity table that
 * scrollWorldAtTheEraPace also uses for the opening era's world pace (names.js). This is one of a
 * family of hex-named shims (0x58B6, 0x598E, 0x5994, 0x599D, 0x59C5, 0x59CB, 0x59D1) that differ
 * only in the table immediate or in where the heading comes from; names.js keeps them all hex
 * because nothing reachable from a shim settles what class of object moves at its pace.
