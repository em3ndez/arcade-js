/** spriteForHeading — pick the sprite shape, and the byte beside it, that show an object pointing the
 * way it is heading. The heading is a point on a 256-step circle; rounded to the nearest of
 * sixteen equal sectors it indexes two parallel sixteen-entry tables, the first holding the
 * shape and the second the byte that mirrors it — eight shapes cover the circle because the rest
 * reuse them mirrored, and the tint those bytes carry is the same in every entry. Every other
 * pair of frames the shape moves on by eight, so each direction alternates between two.
 *
 * ROM 0x2A57-0x2A76 (frozen lift translated/loc_2a57.js). Grounding: [seen].
 *
 * Role in the machine: a dresser shared by two object classes (so it is not the player's own —
 * the player has a finer, 32-sector dresser that stores rather than returns). Its callers store
 * the two bytes it returns into an object's sprite entry: the shape into the entry's +0x01 tile
 * code and the mirror byte into its +0x30 attribute (the entry's +0x00 and +0x31 are the two
 * screen coordinates, written elsewhere by the movers).
 *
 * `object` is the object's sixteen-byte record (the Z80 held it in IX); its byte +2 is the heading
 * the object is currently flying on.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: the pair, left standing for the caller to store into the object's sprite entry; nothing
 * is written. The Z80 returned it in B (shape) and C (mirror byte), which is why both are also
 * left in those registers. */
