/** seatEraSceneryRowThenClearAndRunScenery — seat one era-keyed object band, then hand the frame's scenery on. A fixed run is
 * summed against a constant as a tamper tripwire whose answer is dropped, eight bytes of the row the
 * era indexes are copied into a stride-two cell run, and control transfers into the scenery clear +
 * run: at era four with the fill byte 0x28, otherwise 0xCC. The era and the entry cursor ride into the
 * chain as arguments; the cursor is the era-object entry its one caller has just cleared through (the
 * original leaves it standing in IY), and the chain writes through it only if the scenery guard fails.
 * LIVE-OUT: memory (the seated band and whatever the scenery chain leaves); control leaves through the
 * tail and does not return. */

/*
 * ROM 0x30A5-0x30D0 (then into 0x30D1 / 0x3156), grounding [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x30a5).
 *
 * ROLE. Part of the playfield reset for a new round: its one caller, resetPlayfieldAndArmNewRound
 * (0x19F0), calls it once the object slots are retired. It gives the eight scenery sprites the shape
 * codes of the current era and then runs the era's scenery setup.
 *
 * PARAMETERS. `entryCursor` is the sprite-entry pointer the caller leaves behind (IY in the ROM,
 * defaulting to ERA_OBJECT_ENTRY_SLOT0, 0xAA28, where the caller last pointed it); `recordCursor` is
 * the record pointer the caller leaves behind (IX; resetPlayfieldAndArmNewRound's numbering walk ends
 * it one record past the object run -- under the oracle every dispatch into the scenery clear arrived
 * with IX = 0xA980). Both are only passed on to the scenery chain, where only the seed step's tamper
 * divert reads them.
