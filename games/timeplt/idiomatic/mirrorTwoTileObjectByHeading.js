/** mirrorTwoTileObjectByHeading — dress a two-entry object: give each of its two sprite entries one
 * of a consecutive pair of shape codes, and both of them the same attribute byte. Which entry takes
 * the lower code turns over with the object's heading, at the half-turn boundary, and the attribute
 * changes by exactly one bit at the same boundary — so the pair swaps ends together and still reads
 * as one object rather than two. The base of the pair steps in fours by how many hits the object
 * has left, counted from the most it can take, so it wears its damage; and one bit of the
 * free-running frame counter alternates it, so it flickers between two shapes every other frame.
 * LIVE-OUT: memory only — four bytes.
 *
 * ROM 0x3CE9-0x3D24 (frozen lift translated/loc_3ce9.js). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x3ce9).
 *
 * Role in the machine: the "dressing" step for the big two-sprite object whose hit counter is
 * HITS_REMAINING 0xA8DC [seen] -- names.js ties that counter to the second era's bomber, which is armed
 * with 3 and so absorbs three hits and dies on the fourth. A sprite entry only says where the object is;
 * dressing writes its shape code (+1) and its attribute -- colour and flip bits -- (+0x30), which
 * publishSpriteShadow later copies to the hardware (mechanisms.md, "Dressing a sprite for heading and
 * frame"). Its caller is advanceTwoTileObjectThenTryAimedSpawn.
 *
 * Why it is a MIRROR and not two poses: the two attribute values, 0x6D and 0xED, are the same colour
 * differing only in the flip-Y bit, and the swap falls at two opposite headings, 0x40 and 0xC0. Under
 * MAME each arm took 172 of 344 dispatches (names.js "why"). Unlike the finer heading dressers, the
 * heading is resolved here to one bit: which half of the circle.
 *
 * Parameters: object — the object's record (the ROM hands it in IX; its +2 byte is the heading);
 * entry — the first of its two sprite entries (in IY). The second entry's bytes sit two above the
 * first's: shapes at +1 and +3, attributes at +0x30 and +0x32.
