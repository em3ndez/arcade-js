/** seatCraftSlot2ThenDispatchByEra — hand slot 2's craft record + entry cursors to the era arm. LIVE-OUT: memory.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS: one of the seven small per-slot entries of the enemy-craft band. Time Pilot keeps its
 * enemy craft in a band of seven object records at 0xA850 (stride 0x10), each paired in lockstep with
 * a sprite entry at 0xAA1A (stride 0x02); slot 5 of the band is the Mother-Ship. This entry
 * services slot 2: record CRAFT_RECORD_SLOT2 (0xA870) with sprite entry CRAFT_ENTRY_SLOT2 (0xAA1E).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE: stepSevenCraftSlots (0x28A1) is nothing but an order -- it runs slots 0-4, then
 * the Mother-Ship slot, then slot 6, each through its own seat-and-dispatch entry like this one
 * (mechanisms.md). The only thing that distinguishes this entry from its unconditional siblings is the
 * pair of addresses it seats (names.js).
 *
 * ROM: 0x28CD (0x28CD-0x28D7), frozen lift translated/loc_28cd.js. Grounding tag: [seen]
 * (names.js). The ROM loads IX = 0xA870 and IY = 0xAA1E and jumps into the era dispatcher at 0x290E.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory only -- whatever the selected era handler writes into this slot's record and
 * sprite entry. Nothing is returned beyond what the dispatcher returns.

   * ERA_SLOT_DISPATCH_TABLE (0x2914) to pick the slot handler (serviceEra0..4EnemyCraftSlot for eras 0-4).

   * as a transfer, so its result is this entry's result and nothing here runs after it.
