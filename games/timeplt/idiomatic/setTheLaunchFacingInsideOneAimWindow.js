//
// ROLE IN THE MACHINE. A firing object launches by having a new object commissioned into a free slot
// the finder has staged; commissionStagedAttackerByEra (0x42B7) [seen] -- "the launcher" -- fits that
// new object out by era. Its one static entrant from outside is at 0x4296: when ERA_INDEX reads zero
// (the first era) the spawner comes HERE instead of going to 0x42B7 directly with the object's own
// heading, so in the first era the new object's facing is chosen by alignment and side rather than
// by heading. The launcher turns the 0/1 handed to it into a mirroring of the new object's sprite.
//
// The two lines 0x84 and 0x78 are immediates in the ROM (`ld a,0x84` at 0x42A2, `ld a,0x78` at
// 0x42AA). ATTACKER_SPAWN_AIM_WINDOW_HALF (0xA8E6) [seen] is one of the two aim-window half-widths
// that applyEraRungSettings scatters, so its width is a setting rather than a constant of this code.
//
// LIVE-OUT: memory only; outside the window nothing is written at all.
