/** cyclePlayerSpriteColourThenAdvanceStepAtZero — one frame of an animation that counts down and, while it does, drives a sprite
 * entry's colour field from a single bit of the count, so the colour holds for four frames at a
 * time; the top two bits of that byte, where the shape's mirroring lives, are left alone. The
 * frame on which the count is found already at zero also moves the step cell on, and the count
 * still steps that frame, wrapping below zero.
 *
 * ROM 0x1393-0x13CB (frozen lift translated/loc_1393.js). Grounding: [seen].
 *
 * Role in the machine: part of the between-eras band animation that plays after a round is won.
 * stepRoundStartIntroAnimation dispatches on INTRO_ANIMATION_STEP (0xA9F0), and its step 2 -- the
 * one call site -- runs this and then advanceScriptedCharPlaneBandTo4. The byte written,
 * PLAYER_SPRITE_ATTRIBUTE (0xAA40), is the shadow of the player ship's sprite attribute (colour +
 * flip bits), which publishSpriteShadow copies to the hardware.
 *
 * SPRITE_COLOUR_CYCLE_COUNTDOWN (0xA9F3) is seeded 4 (names.js), so bit 2 is set on the first
 * call only (colour 0x37) and clear afterwards (0x3F); when it is found at zero, the step moves on
 * to 3.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory. */
