/** steerEnemyTowardShip — steer one live slot toward its aim heading, then fly it a step. When the slot's probe
 * cell sits within a fixed window of either reference point, the turn runs with the shared rate index
 * forced to zero and then reseated to four; otherwise it runs at the standing index. The step then
 * alternates a double- and a single-velocity mover on bit 1 of the frame tick. LIVE-OUT: memory.
 *
 * ROM 0x29F7-0x2A2A. names.js tag: [seen].
 *
 * Role in the machine: the live (0xFF) arm of serviceEra4EnemyCraftSlot, the fifth era's (ERA_INDEX 4) entry in
 * the per-era slot-handler table at 0x2914. Every frame each live enemy craft in that era comes
 * through here once: its heading is turned one notch toward the heading it aims at
 * (steerTowardAimHeading), and it is then moved one step along that heading.
 *
 * The "shared rate index" is ERA_INDEX (0xAD04) itself. steerTowardAimHeading takes its turn step
 * from a five-entry per-era table (TURN_RATE_BY_ERA_TABLE, 0x2C1D) keyed on that cell, so writing 0
 * to it for the length of one turn borrows the first era's turn rate. This routine only runs in the
 * fifth era (ERA_INDEX 4), which is why the ROM puts back the constant 4 rather than a saved value.
 *
 * Inputs: `iy` is the slot's sprite entry and `ix` its object record, both seated by the slot sweep
 * that dispatched here. */
