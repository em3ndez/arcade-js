/** clearSceneryEntriesThenRunEraScenery — clear a stride-two run of eight object cells to the fill byte the caller hands in A,
 * then branch on the era and two runtime guards. Below era four one path seats and runs the whole
 * frame's scenery; at era four and up, when the guard pair reads its expected values a second packed
 * table fills eight entry cells before the scenery runs; a guard that reads wrong transfers into a
 * data table and faults. LIVE-OUT: memory. The clear loop's stride and its spent count are handed to
 * the seed step below era four, because its guard-fail divert stores the one and counts down the
 * other (the original leaves them in E and B); every other register the body touches is scratch.
 *
 * ROM 0x30D1-0x3113 (frozen lift translated/loc_30d1.js). Grounding: [seen] in names.js.
 *
 * Role in the machine: part of setting up the scenery (the backdrop objects that scroll past the
 * ship — clouds in the sky eras, asteroids in space, per gameplay.md) for the era being entered. Its caller, seatEraSceneryRowThenClearAndRunScenery
 * (0x30A5), has just copied the era's row from the 0x3176 table and tails in here with the era in C
 * and the fill byte in A (0x28 at era four, else 0xCC).
 *
 * The guard pair is an anti-tamper check: TAMPER_GLYPH_KONAMI (0xACC7) holds a glyph sampled from the
 * "(c) KONAMI 1982" caption, and the byte after it its companion. A genuine image reads 0x3B and
 * then 0x05 or 0x10; anything else sends the machine through loc_315b into 0x3176, a data table
 * executed as code, which is how the ROM derails a tampered copy.
 *
 * Parameters: `fillByte` (A) and `era` (C) come from the caller as above; `entryCursor` (IY) and
 * `recordCursor` (IX) are passed on unchanged to the below-era-four seed step. */
