/** foldBlockIntoTotal — add a run of bytes into a total the caller has already started. The Z80 also walked a
 * SECOND pointer alongside it a byte at a time, overwriting one byte-sized holder at each step, and
 * left that holder, both pointers and the spent count standing in registers; the second walk
 * contributes nothing to the total and nothing after the call reads any of what it left, so it
 * is not repeated here. The second pointer and the holder's prior value are still accepted, so
 * the call keeps the shape its callers use. The length arrives as a count that means a full 256
 * when it is zero, and the total wraps at eight bits. Nothing is written.
 * LIVE-OUT: the total, returned and left standing in A for a caller that reaches it by address. */
