/**
 * serviceRoundThenResolvePlayerState — the round engine: run every subsystem of a round in one fixed
 * order, then read the player's state and resolve the round — advance it, take a life, or carry on.
 *
 * ROM 0x1199-0x11EC (falls through into 0x11ED). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x1199).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. Almost all of Time Pilot runs inside the vertical-blank interrupt, which
 * each time runs one arm of a two-level sequence machine. This is arm 7 of phase 3 (the round
 * engine, entry 7 of the sub-step table at 0x0F29), and it is the game itself: both a real game and
 * the attract demo (the same engine, flown by an autopilot) spend their play time here. It runs once
 * per dispatch of that sub-step.
 *
 * WHY THE ORDER MATTERS. The player's frame runs second — only the enemy re-aim runs before it — so
 * the world scroll the ship sets this pass is what every later mover reads. Every mover (shots,
 * enemy wave, parachutist, Mother-Ship, craft, scenery, object banks) runs before the collision pass,
 * so every contact is judged on positions already moved this pass. Bookkeeping (bonus life, hit
 * chain, difficulty, kill meter) comes last.
 *
 * WHY THE SPRITE PASSES REPEAT. multiplexSpriteSlotsSkipping [seen] is a scanline-gated fixup over
 * eight sprite slots: a flagged slot whose position the raster has already passed gets its
 * coordinates adjusted then and there. Because it depends on where the beam is, it is called between
 * groups of services, repeatedly, while the work runs; multiplexSpriteSlots [seen] closes the list,
 * waiting on the raster to move each requested scenery slot half a screen so one sprite shows twice
 * in a frame.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: everything the subsystem services write, plus whichever resolution arm runs.
