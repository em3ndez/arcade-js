/** flyAlongHeading — fly one object a single step along the heading it holds, while the world scrolls
 * underneath it. That heading picks a pair of perpendicular components out of the speed
 * table the caller chose; each of the object's two coordinates then gains its own component PLUS
 * a per-frame displacement held in a fixed pair of cells, shared by every object rather than read
 * off this one. Each coordinate is 16 bits stored split: the whole part in the sprite entry, the
 * fraction in the record, so a component smaller than a pixel banks instead of vanishing.
 *
 * ROM 0x58BC-0x58FD (frozen lift translated/loc_58bc.js). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x58bc).
 *
 * Role in the machine: the common mover for objects that fly on a heading. Every entry into it is
 * a two-instruction shim that fixes one velocity table, so the table — and with it the speed — is
 * the only thing a caller chooses (names.js). The shared pair is the world scroll (WORLD_SCROLL_Y,
 * WORLD_SCROLL_X), the camera: because it is folded into the same add, no caller drifts the object
 * separately, and adding a drift beside this would apply the camera twice.
 *
 * `table` is the velocity table (HL on the Z80), `object` the record (IX), `sprite` the entry (IY).
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory only — the four coordinate bytes; nothing is clamped and nothing is returned. */
