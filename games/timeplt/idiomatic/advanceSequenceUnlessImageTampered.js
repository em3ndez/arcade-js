 * advanceSequenceUnlessImageTampered — ROM 0x5303 [seen]
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. The verdict step of one of the program image's anti-tamper checks. Earlier links of
 * the chain (sumImageBlockForTheTamperCheck 0x43E8 -> parkTheImageTotalForTheTamperVerdict) fold a
 * block of ROM bytes into an 8-bit total and hand it here; a genuine, unmodified ROM always
 * produces 0x67.
 *
 * ROLE. Present the checksum the caller carried, then relay by its verdict: the one value a
 * genuine image yields steps the attract sequence on (advanceSequenceSubStep 0x0F1A), anything else
 * springs the tamper trap (loc_0F8D), which unwinds the caller chain instead of returning normally.
 * Under MAME the trap took zero dispatches on the real ROM -- a genuine image never fails.
 * Reads and writes nothing itself; the chosen arm owns all of that.
 *
 * PARAMETERS: total = the carried checksum (B in the ROM); pointer and offset = the HL and DE the
 * chain carries, which presentChecksumForTamperTest walks forward as arithmetic only and which
 * nothing downstream dereferences.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: that arm's memory and its return.
