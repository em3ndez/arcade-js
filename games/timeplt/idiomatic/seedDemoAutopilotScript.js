/** seedDemoAutopilotScript — seed the attract-demo autopilot: pick a heading-command script by the demo selector,
 * seat its dwell counter and little-endian pointer, then gate on the tamper readback. LIVE-OUT: memory-only.
 *
 * ROM 0x210E-0x2149 (frozen lift translated/loc_210e.js). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES
 * 0x210e). Role in the machine: called by verifyImageSignatureThenStartAttractDemoOrDerail when
 * the attract demo starts. The attract demo is the real round engine with PLAY_ACTIVE clear, and
 * the ship is flown by flyDemoShipByScript stepping one of three byte-coded scripts in ROM; this
 * routine chooses the script and points the autopilot at its start (mechanisms.md, "The demo
 * autopilot").
 *
 * The selector is PLAYER_ONE_ERA_INDEX [seen], which the attract arm overloads for this purpose.
 * The demo's own era is written into that cell only AFTER this runs, so the script is chosen from
 * the value left behind by the previous demo (mechanisms.md).
