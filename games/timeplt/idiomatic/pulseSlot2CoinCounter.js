/** pulseSlot2CoinCounter — drive one hardware output line as a train of square pulses, one pulse per unit of a
 * pending count, and stop when the count reaches zero.
 * With nothing pending it does nothing at all. With something pending and no pulse under way it
 * arms a fixed-length phase counter and raises the line. Otherwise it counts that phase down one
 * per call: at exactly the halfway value it drops the line again, so the line is high for the
 * first half of a phase and low for the second; at zero it takes one off the pending count, which
 * lets the next call start the next pulse. The halfway test is an equality, so a phase counter
 * disturbed past that value from outside would run the whole phase with the line still high.
 * LIVE-OUT: memory, plus the output line.
 *
 * ROM: 0x49D6. Tag [seen] (names.js). Role in the machine: coin slot 2's mechanical coin counter. It
 * is the twin of pulseSlot1CoinCounter (0x4984) — byte-identical but for three operands: the debt
 * cell COIN_ACCEPTED_SLOT_2 0xA982 [code], the timer COIN_PULSE_TIMER_SLOT_2 0xA985 [code] and the
 * latch line COIN_COUNTER_1_LATCH 0xC30C (bit 6 of the board's LS259 latch, the driver's
 * LATCH_COIN_COUNTER_1). Each coin taken on slot 2 owes one click of that counter, and this routine
 * pays the debt off one separate on-then-off pulse at a time, so two quick coins give two clicks.
