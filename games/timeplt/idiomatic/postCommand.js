/** postCommand — append a command byte and its argument to the 64-cell command ring. A cell is
 * free while its high bit is set; when the one the write cursor names is still occupied the pair
 * is DROPPED silently. Otherwise both bytes go in and the cursor steps two cells on, wrapping
 * inside the ring. It claims nothing about what a command byte selects or when it is acted on.
 * LIVE-OUT: memory-only.
 *
 * ROM: 0x0038, the RST 0x38 restart vector. Tag [seen] (names.js). Role in the machine: the one way
 * anything — frame code inside the vertical-blank interrupt or the foreground — asks for work to be
 * done later. The foreground loop runCommandRingDrainLoop takes pairs off the ring and dispatches
 * them (mechanisms.md: captions are requested inside the interrupt and drawn outside it; every
 * score award is posted here too, so a full ring loses the award).
 *
 * Parameters: `command` (the ROM's D) and `argument` (E), whatever the caller wants posted. */
