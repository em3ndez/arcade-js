/** freeAllShotSlots — clear the six-slot shot record array, zeroing each slot's first and fifth bytes. Fill byte
 * and slot stride are read from program space (on this image fill=0, stride=16). LIVE-OUT: memory + the record cursor past the last slot.
 *
 * ROM 0x2755-0x2770 (lift: translated/loc_2755.js). Grounding: [seen].
 *
 * Role in the machine: the player's shots live in their own six-record array at PLAYER_SHOT_ARRAY
 * (0xAA80, 16-byte records, no sprite entries). Freeing them belongs to the start of a life: the
 * only caller is the life-start routine resetPlayfieldAndArmNewRound, and under MAME the store fired
 * exactly as often as the life-start store wrote the player alive. Each record's +0 is its
 * occupancy byte; +4 is a byte of its position (see the shot-array note in names.js). No other
 * byte of a record is touched.
 *
 * Patch-sensitive by construction: neither the fill nor the stride is an immediate in the code,
 * both are fetched from bytes elsewhere in the program image, so changing either byte would make
 * this clear a different pattern at a different stride.
