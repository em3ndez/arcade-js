/** verifyImageSignatureThenStartAttractDemoOrDerail — a phase-1 attract sub-step arm (computed
 * dispatch off the phase-1 table at inner sub-step 12, no static call site). It reads the folded
 * program-image signature the self-check banked at TAMPER_IMAGE_SIGNATURE and compares it against a
 * fixed byte. The two agree on a genuine image, where the self-check fold always lands on that byte,
 * so the mismatch arm is dead: it is only ever reached on a tampered image, and there it derails
 * into a data-run-as-code landing that destroys control rather than reporting. There is no faithful
 * transcription of that landing as a routine, so this arm raises where it would derail instead.
 *
 * On the genuine image it starts the attract-mode autopilot demo: it parks the caption sprites,
 * seeds the demo autopilot heading script, then clears the two-player flag, player two's lives, the
 * play-active flag and the inner sequence sub-step, stocks player one with one life, and winds the
 * outer sequence on to its last phase (3) — the phase where the demo actually flies. Because
 * PLAY_ACTIVE is cleared rather than raised, this is the demo run, not a real game.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory only. The arm is reached by computed dispatch and its successor reloads every
 * register it uses before reading one, so no register is live out. */
