/** closeOneTurnOfTheFreeSlotSearch — step both cursors BACKWARD one whole element and strike one off
 * the count; while any remain, hand the stepped cursors and the count back to the body that works one
 * slot, else just return. The cursors and the count travel as arguments from turn to turn and are
 * dead once the search ends. LIVE-OUT: memory.
 *
 * ROM 0x3847-0x3854 (frozen lift translated/loc_3847.js). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. The loop tail of the search for a free enemy slot. The body,
 * spawnEnemyIntoFreeSlotElseStepSearch (0x37D6), looks at one slot: a free slot is claimed and
 * stocked and the search ends there; an OCCUPIED slot jumps here (`jp nz,0x3847` at 0x37DA is the
 * only reference to this address in the image). So every turn closed here is a turn that found
 * its slot taken, and the loop walks the slot bank DOWNWARD until a free slot is found or the
 * count runs out, in which case the search ends having filled nothing.
 *
 * Its near-twin closeOneTurnOfTheSlotSweep (0x410B) steps its cursors FORWARD and ends in a real
 * `djnz`; this one steps backward and is `dec b / jp nz`, so the jump reads the decrement's flags.
