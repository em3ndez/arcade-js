 * destroyFixedTargetHitByShots — ROM 0x4F7E [seen]
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. The collision test between the player's bullets and the one fixed target held in
 * era-object slot 0 (record ERA_OBJECT_RECORD_SLOT0 0xA8C0, sprite entry ERA_OBJECT_ENTRY_SLOT0
 * 0xAA28). The bullets are the six 16-byte shot records at PLAYER_SHOT_ARRAY (0xAA80), which
 * fireAndSweepPlayerShots arms on a fire-button press.
 *
 * ROLE. Run the target against the whole shot array and destroy the shots that reached it. The
 * target's state byte is tested for "live" ONCE, before the sweep, and never re-tested, so several
 * shots can be spent on it in a single pass: each live slot is tested on both axes as a wrapped
 * window around the target, and a slot inside both is marked destroyed together with the target,
 * and a score is posted for it. The slot cursor steps only the low half of its address, so a wide
 * enough array would wrap inside its page. Under MAME both stores were seen to fire.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory only (the target and shots it destroys, the score it posts); its one caller
 * seeds its next sweep afresh, so nothing the sweep leaves behind is read after it.
