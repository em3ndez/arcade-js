// ROLE IN THE MACHINE. This is the coin-slot-2 accept arm of the coin/credit pipeline. Its sibling
// awardOneCreditOnDebouncedInputEdge (0x48E7) does the same debounce on IN0 bit 2 but awards one
// credit flat; this one METERS coins against the cabinet's coinage setting before it pays. The
// setting lives in COIN_SLOT_2_RATIO (0xA9CC) [seen], unpacked once at boot from the DIP switches:
// high nibble = coins required minus one, low nibble = credits paid. Each accepted coin steps the
// slot's own accumulator (COIN_SLOT_2_ACCUMULATOR, 0xA9CB) by 0x10 -- one coin in the high nibble --
// and a payout happens only once that count has passed the setting's coins-minus-one.
//
// LIVE-OUT: COIN_SLOT_2_DEBOUNCE, and on an accepted coin a sound request, COIN_ACCEPTED_SLOT_2 and
// COIN_SLOT_2_ACCUMULATOR; on a payout, whatever awardCoinCreditThenPulseCoinCounter writes (the
// credit count, its on-screen field, the coin-counter pulse).
