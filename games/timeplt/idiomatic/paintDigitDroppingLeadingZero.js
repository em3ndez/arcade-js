/** paintDigitDroppingLeadingZero — paint one digit, with its colour, into the cell a cursor names — or suppress it.
 *
 * Only the low four bits of the value arriving choose the shape, out of a table in the program
 * image. A value that is not zero always paints and spends the whole suppression allowance at
 * once, so nothing after it can be suppressed. A zero paints only when that allowance is already
 * spent; while it is not, nothing is painted, one unit of allowance goes, and the cursor steps
 * BACK one place — so a caller that steps forward after every digit leaves the blank occupying
 * no space at all. The run pointer the caller was walking is handed back where it was, and the
 * cursor comes back on the glyph side of the two planes whether or not it arrived there.
 *
 * ROM 0x0EEB-0x0F05 (frozen lift translated/loc_0eeb.js). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x0EEB).
 *
 * Role in the machine: the digit painter behind the STAGE caption. drawRoundNumberCaption (ring
 * command 7) paints ROUND_NUMBER through it as two digits, so a leading zero is DROPPED — it takes
 * no cell, the surviving digit landing where the tens digit would have been — while a trailing zero
 * always shows. That is the difference from its twin paintSuppressedDigit, which paints a BLANK glyph
 * in a suppressed place and so keeps the field's width. names.js records the MAME write tap that
 * separates the two: stage 37 made two character writes, stage 7 made one.
 *
 * The screen: the character plane (glyphs, based at 0xA400) and the colour plane (based at 0xA000)
 * hold the same grid at the same offsets, told apart only by address bit 10 (0x0400). So one cursor
 * reaches both a cell's glyph and its colour by clearing or setting that bit.
 *
 * Parameters (with where their values come from in the ROM): `value` the digit in its low nibble (A);
 * `allowance` how many leading zeros may still be dropped (B), set by the caller before the run;
 * `colour` the colour byte (C); `de` the cursor, the character-plane cell to paint (DE). The ROM
 * also saves and restores the caller's run pointer (HL) around the table lookup; nothing here
 * touches HL, so it is left exactly where the caller had it.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: the two cells, and [allowance, cursor] returned (both also left in B and DE). */
