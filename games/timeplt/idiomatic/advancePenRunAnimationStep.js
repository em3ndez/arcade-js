 * advancePenRunAnimationStep — one step of the sequence machine that runs the "pen" along its route:
 * advance the interpolated pen run by one run, and only when that run has finished (it reseated to a
 * zero row integer) take an anti-tamper checksum and step the sequence on.
 *
 * ROM 0x1734-0x1747. Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x1734).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. Its one caller is dispatchSequencePhase1SubStepArm, the inner arm table of one
 * outer sequence mode. The sequence machine (SEQUENCE_PHASE / SEQUENCE_SUBSTEP, both [seen]) calls one
 * arm per frame and only moves to the next arm when the current one steps SEQUENCE_SUBSTEP. This arm
 * therefore repeats frame after frame, each frame stamping one more run of pen cells (attract step 0 has set the
 * pen to the blank glyph 0xF1, so here the runs erase the route leg by leg -- mechanisms.md "Step 1"), until the drawer
 * reports that the run it just finished reseated to row zero; that frame the arm hands on.
 *
 * WHY THE CHECKSUM. On its way out the arm sums (negatively) the 34 bytes of the routine at ROM 0x1748
 * (holdCopyrightThenEraseTheCoinInvitation_ADDR, read here as DATA, not called) and parks the result
 * in 0xA817. On a genuine image the sum is 0x00 (checked against the ROM image); an edited routine
 * leaves a non-zero value. names.js BANK_LAUNCH_COOLDOWN [seen] records that 0xA817 is MULTIPLEXED:
 * in boot/attract it carries this checksum verdict, which the credit line later reads; in play it is
 * the bank-launch cooldown. The name imported here is the in-play name of the same cell.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory only (0xA817 and, via the tail, SEQUENCE_SUBSTEP).
