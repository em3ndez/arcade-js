/** stepSlotApproachThenBreakawayRetire — the per-frame handler for one slot in an object sweep. The record byte at +4 is an
 * approach countdown: while it runs, count it down by one and drive the object through its full
 * chased-object frame. The tick it reaches zero, fly the object at double velocity, animate its
 * shape, and retire the slot only if it has drifted onto a retire line. Either way step the sweep
 * onto the next slot. The record, its sprite entry and the sweep's turns left are arguments, handed
 * on to the turn-closer. LIVE-OUT: memory.
 *
 * ROM 0x4194-0x41B7. names.js tag: [seen].
 *
 * Role in the machine: one arm of serviceSlotByMarkerThenCloseSweepTurn, the body of the object-bank
 * sweep. That body sends a slot here when its marker byte (ix+0) is 0xFF (live) and ERA_INDEX is 4,
 * i.e. only in the fifth era (2001). Like every arm of that body it ends at closeOneTurnOfTheSlotSweep
 * (0x410B), which steps both cursors on to the next slot and re-enters the body while turns remain --
 * so this call services this slot and, through the closer, the rest of the bank.
 *
 * Inputs: `ix` is the slot's sixteen-byte object record, `iy` its sprite entry, `b` the sweep's
 * turns left; all three are seated by the sweep and only passed through here.
 *
 * The object's life in this arm has two phases, told apart by the countdown at record +4:
 *   - approach (countdown nonzero): flyTowardShipStandoffThenEndApproach steers the object at one of
 *     two fixed points and itself cuts the countdown to zero once it gets close, so the approach can
 *     end early as well as by running out;
 *   - breakaway (countdown zero): the object flies straight on at double velocity until it reaches a
 *     retire line, and then the slot is freed. */
