/** drawEmblemStripThenGuardImage — stamp a row of award emblems, then blank the rest of that row.
 * The enable cell gates the whole routine. The caller's count, clamped to six, sets how many
 * two-by-two emblems to stamp leftward from a fixed cursor; the cursor then carries on and the row
 * is blanked down to a fixed floor. A running XOR over a fixed program span guards the image last.
 *
 * ROM 0x4D72-0x4DAE. Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x4D72).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. This is command 5's handler in the command ring (word-table slot 5 at
 * 0x0BBC): the reserve-ships HUD. The count it is handed is the number of ships in reserve --
 * loadActivePlayerContextAndPostRoundHud posts LIVES_REMAINING minus one when a turn begins, and
 * awardBonusLifeAtScoreMark posts the same figure after a bonus life (mechanisms.md §8). Any
 * reserve beyond six is simply not shown. Because the enable cell is PLAY_ACTIVE 0xAD30 [seen],
 * which is clear throughout the attract demo, the strip is only ever drawn in credited play.
 *
 * The tail is an anti-tamper check, not part of the HUD: the 256 program bytes at
 * IMAGE_GUARD_BLOCK_0711_BASE (0x0711-0x0810) XOR-folded, plus 25, must come to zero on a genuine
 * image. On the real board a mismatch takes `jp nz,0x4BB1` into the default high-score block --
 * data, run as code (mechanisms.md, "Derails into data"); this port stops with an error there.
 * PARAMETER: count = the reserve-ship count, the ring command's argument (the ROM's A).
 * LIVE-OUT: memory only. */
