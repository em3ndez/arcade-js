/** restartAnimationCounterThenDressFlutterSprite — close out one object's animation and dress its sprite entry. The counter the caller
 * carries is read without the top bit that selected this path; once what is left has reached three
 * the counter cell in the object's record is put back to zero, and below three it is left alone.
 * Either way both attribute slots of the sprite entry take the one code fixed here, and the two
 * shape codes are then chosen by the flutter this hands on to.
 * LIVE-OUT: memory — the counter cell, the two attributes, and the pair of shapes.
 *
 * ROM 0x44C9-0x44DB, falling through into 0x44DC (frozen lift translated/loc_44c9.js).
 * Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x44c9). The name deliberately says only what this body
 * does: what the object ends up looking like is settled one routine further on, and the counter
 * it may clear lives in a record whose owner it never reads (names.js).
 *
 * Parameters: `counter` is the value the caller carries in C, whose top bit chose this path;
 * `record` is the object's record (IX); `sprite` is its sprite entry (IY).
