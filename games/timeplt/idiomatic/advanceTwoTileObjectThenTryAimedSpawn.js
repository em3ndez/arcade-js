// ROM 0x3B77-0x3B93 (lift: translated/loc_3b77.js). Grounding tag in names.js ROUTINES: [seen].
//
// ROLE IN THE MACHINE. This object is drawn as two sprite entries stacked one above the other, so
// every frame both must be moved together. names.js records the caller as serviceEra1BomberObject
// (0x3B5F): in era 1 it dispatches the single object at record 0xA8C0 on its head byte, and a head of
// 0xFF runs THIS routine -- the per-frame "fly it" arm of that object's life.
//
// PARAMETERS. `record` is the object's work-RAM record (the ROM's IX) and `sprite` is its sprite entry
// (the ROM's IY); both are seated by the caller and passed straight through to every step below.
//
// LIVE-OUT: memory only -- the object's record and its two sprite entries, plus whatever the retire
// or spawn tails write. Nothing is returned to the caller beyond what those tails return.
