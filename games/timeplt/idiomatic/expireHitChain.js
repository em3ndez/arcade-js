/** expireHitChain — count the chained-hit window down by one per call and, once it has already run
 * out, hold the chain step next to it at zero. The two are not done together: while the window
 * still has anything in it the step is left alone, and once the window reads zero it stops being
 * counted and the step is cleared instead — on every call, not once. LIVE-OUT: memory.
 *
 * ROM 0x5205-0x5210 (lift: translated/loc_5205.js). Grounding: [seen].
 *
 * Role in the machine: shooting enemies in quick succession pays out on an award ladder. The
 * scoring post reloads CHAIN_WINDOW (0xA99D) to 30 on every hit and climbs CHAIN_STEP (0xA99E),
 * the rung the next hit is paid at. This routine, an entry of the round engine's service block
 * (called from serviceRoundThenResolvePlayerState), is the only thing that ends a chain: the
 * poster has no path that resets the step itself. It runs once per dispatch of that service
 * block — NOT once a frame — so the window is 30 of those ticks, not half a second.
