 * advanceSequenceElseStartFreePlayGame — ROM 0x167B [seen]
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. A shared tail of the two-level sequence machine. The machine's outer mode lives in
 * SEQUENCE_PHASE (0xA9AB) and the step inside that mode in SEQUENCE_SUBSTEP (0xA9AC); per names.js,
 * one outer mode's inner dispatcher runs the arm its inner index selects and then this tail.
 *
 * ROLE. It decides whether the machine leaves the current mode:
 *   - a nonzero credit count steps the outer phase on (advanceSequencePhase, 0x0F11, which also
 *     restarts the inner step at zero) and returns;
 *   - otherwise, only under free play and while a start button is held, it sweeps every sprite
 *     off the picture and starts a game charging no credit.
 * The body matches advanceAttractTowardGameStart (0x0F54) except that it has no "play active"
 * guard and steps the phase rather than reloading it from a ROM byte.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory.
