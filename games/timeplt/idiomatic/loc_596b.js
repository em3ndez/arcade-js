/** loc_596b — hand back the perpendicular component pair an object's heading calls for, at the pace one fixed table
 * of velocity samples sets. Choosing it is all this entry does; an incoming pointer is discarded. LIVE-OUT: the pair.
 *
 * ROM 0x596B-0x596D (frozen lift translated/loc_596b.js): a single `ld hl,0x08fa`, after which execution
 * FALLS THROUGH into velocityForHeading, whose code starts at the very next address, 0x596E — there is
 * no jump at all. Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x596B).
 *
 * What it is: a one-instruction shim in front of velocityForHeading. velocityForHeading reads an
 * object's heading (record byte +2, a point on a 256-step circle) and returns two samples a quarter
 * turn apart from whatever 256-word velocity table it is handed; the two samples are the object's
 * perpendicular velocity components, and the table's peak value is the speed. This entry exists only
 * to hand it ONE particular table.
 *
 * Role in the machine: the table here is the one at 0x08FA (VELOCITY_TABLE_08FA in names.js), the
 * top rung of the velocity ladder, peaking at 331 (about 1.3 pixels per step in 8.8 fixed point) —
 * the pace mechanisms.md gives the fourth and fifth eras (1982, 2001). The same bytes double as the
 * anti-tamper checksum-failure landing (loc_08fa); on a genuine image they are only read as data.
 * Its siblings loc_594e (0x5E00, peak 256) and loc_5965 (0x2E3E, peak 306) are the same shim with
 * the other two rungs the ship uses.
 *
 * Whatever pointer the caller had in HL is overwritten by the table base, which is why no incoming
 * pointer survives.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: the component pair velocityForHeading leaves (DE, BC) — the pair is the whole product;
 * no memory is written.
