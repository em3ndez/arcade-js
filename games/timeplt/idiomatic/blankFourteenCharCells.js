/** blankFourteenCharCells — blank a fourteen-cell run of the character plane and paint every one
 * of those cells the same colour. It starts at a fixed cell and walks a row at a time in the
 * direction that takes it back up the plane, so the whole run is decided here and no caller can
 * steer it. The run holds one column of the plane and varies the row, which is not the axis it
 * occupies on the glass; the name says how many cells, not where.
 *
 * ROM 0x07D2-0x07E5 (frozen lift translated/loc_07d2.js). Grounding: [seen] -- under MAME a write
 * tap gated to this routine's program counters found exactly 0xA79F - 0x20k for k = 0..13, each
 * written only with the blanking glyph, and no other video address (names.js).
 *
 * Role in the machine: a clean-up step run before the screen is redrawn. Its two callers are
 * blankCaptionThenAdvancePenRunStep and loadActivePlayerContextAndPostRoundHud, and each calls it
 * first, before doing anything else. The fixed start cell is KILL_METER_BAR_START_CELL (0xA79F), the
 * same cell drawKillMeter starts the kill-meter bar from, walking the same -0x20 stride.
 *
 * Under this board's ROT90 the native column it walks is a display ROW (names.js "why").
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: the twenty-eight cells written. */
