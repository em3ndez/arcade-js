/**
 * retireObjectAndHold — take an object and the slot one stride on out of play, then hold the caller's
 * slot on a delay rather than release it.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS: ROM routine 0x3C0D [seen]. Six bytes go to zero: the head (occupancy) byte of the record
 * the caller points at AND of the record one stride on, both coordinates of the sprite entry the caller
 * points at, and both coordinates of one FIXED entry, ERA_OBJECT_ENTRY_SLOT1, that no argument selects.
 * A seventh byte of the caller's record, offset 14, is then set to 128 instead of being cleared.
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE: "hold" means the byte left standing is a delay, not a survivor of the wipe. It
 * was watched: the record head went to zero and that byte jumped to 128 in the same frame, then counted
 * down by one every OTHER frame -- the cadence of the routine at 0x3C25, which gates its decrement on
 * FRAME_TICK's low bit and branches only when the byte reaches zero. Its siblings retireSlot and
 * retireSlotAndSubPixel clear their record and stop; this one retires a second record and a fixed entry
 * as well, and arms the delay.
 *
 * PARAMETERS: `record` is the object's state record (the ROM passes it in IX), `entry` its sprite entry
 * (IY). LIVE-OUT: memory only -- those seven bytes.
