/** dispatchPlayerFrameByState — seat the player record and its paired sprite entry, then route the frame on the
 * player-state byte: leave at once while it is clear, drive the multi-frame animation while it is
 * mid-count, and once it is fully wound either fly the demo pilot (no live play), turn the ship
 * toward the read stick, or just scroll the world when the stick is centred. LIVE-OUT: memory.
 *
 * ROM 0x1EDF-0x1F00 (frozen lift translated/loc_1edf.js). Grounding: [seen] in names.js.
 *
 * Role in the machine: the player's per-frame handler. The player owns record 0xA800 (PLAYER_STATE
 * is its head byte) and sprite entry 0xAA10 (PLAYER_ENTRY); the ROM seats them in IX/IY at 0x1EDF.
 * PLAYER_STATE reads 0xFF while the ship is alive, 0xF0 when a death starts (then counts down), and
 * 0x00 once torn down. Because the ship stays at the screen's centre, "flying" it means turning it
 * and scrolling the world past it. */
