//
// ROLE IN THE MACHINE. The ordinary enemy craft live in a band of seven sixteen-byte records starting at
// CRAFT_RECORD_SLOT0 (0xA850) [seen]. driveEnemyWaveForLifePhase runs the enemy-wave step of each life
// and picks its arm from the middle digit of the life's work counter; this is the arm for phase 8 (the
// caller's `phase < 9` test after the lower phases). It tops the band up only when it is nearly empty
// (fewer than two busy records), and only on the ticks its gate opens. The pointer the caller passes is LIFE_TICKS_LOW
// (0xAD05) [seen], the low packed-decimal digit pair of that counter (00..60), so the gate below opens
// twice per pass of that byte.
//
// Which search runs depends on KILLS_REMAINING (0xAD02) [seen], the manual's kill quota before the
// Mother-Ship appears: with nothing owed, loc_3793 seats the five-slot run; while kills are owed, the
// search runs from slot 6 (CRAFT_RECORD_SLOT6 / CRAFT_ENTRY_SLOT6) downward for ROUND_CRAFT_COUNT
// (0xACC1) [seen] turns.
//
// LIVE-OUT: memory -- whatever the free-slot search stages; nothing when the gate is shut or the band
// already has two busy records.
