/** seatCraftSlot0ThenDispatchByEra — hand slot 0's craft record + entry cursors to the era arm. LIVE-OUT: memory. */

/*
 * ROM 0x28B7-0x28C1, grounding [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x28b7).
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. The enemy craft live in a band of seven 16-byte records starting at CRAFT_RECORD_SLOT0
 * (0xA850, [seen]), each with a two-byte sprite entry starting at CRAFT_ENTRY_SLOT0 (0xAA1A, [seen]).
 * Each frame the round engine services the band slot by slot through a family of tiny entries --
 * seatCraftSlot0..4ThenDispatchByEra, plus two more (seatMotherShipSlotThenDispatchByEraUnlessArmed,
 * seatCraftSlot6ThenDispatchByEraUnlessArmed) gated on the mother ship's armed cell -- and this is the
 * slot-0 member. Its pair of fixed addresses is the whole of what tells it apart from slots 1-4.
 *
 * ROLE. Point the per-slot machinery at slot 0, then let dispatchSeatedSlotByEraIndex (0x290E) pick
 * the handler for the current era (the craft fly differently in each era) and run it on this slot.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory only -- whatever the era handler writes into slot 0's record and sprite entry.
