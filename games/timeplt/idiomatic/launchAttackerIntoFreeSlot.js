 * launchAttackerIntoFreeSlot — let one enemy craft launch an attacker into the era-object bank.
 *
 * ROM 0x4243-0x429B. Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x4243).
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. Some enemy craft release a second object (an attacker) into the three-slot era-object
 * bank (records from ERA_OBJECT_RECORD_SLOT0 0xA8C0, sprite entries from ERA_OBJECT_ENTRY_SLOT0
 * 0xAA28). This is the gate in front of that launch. It runs for the craft whose slot the caller is
 * servicing, but acts only on that craft's own turn of an eight-frame round, only once a shared spawn
 * cooldown has run out, only when a bank slot is free, and only when the craft is not too close to
 * two fixed lines (0x78 on one sprite coordinate, 0x84 on the other).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. Called from the per-slot enemy-craft services of eras 0, 2, 3 and 4
 * (serviceEra0/2/3/4EnemyCraftSlot). On success it stashes the free slot's record and sprite-entry
 * addresses in SCRATCH_PTR_A / SCRATCH_PTR_B (0xA991 / 0xA993) and tails into a launcher: in era 0
 * the aim-window launcher (0x429C, setTheLaunchFacingInsideOneAimWindow), in any other era the
 * heading-follows launcher (0x42B7, commissionStagedAttackerByEra), which is handed the craft's
 * heading byte (record +0x02) as the new object's facing.
 *
 * PARAMETERS. `ix` is the launching craft's object record, `iy` its sprite entry.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory.
