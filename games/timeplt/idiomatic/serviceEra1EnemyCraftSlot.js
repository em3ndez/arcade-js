 * serviceEra1EnemyCraftSlot — one frame of one enemy-craft slot in era 1 (1940).
 *
 * ROM 0x294C. Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x294c).
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. Enemy craft live in object slots: a sixteen-byte record whose first
 * byte is the slot's status, paired with a sprite entry. This routine services one such slot for one
 * frame, branching on the status byte:
 *   - 0x00 (empty): nothing to do;
 *   - 0xFE (held): count the hold down and release the craft when it expires (releaseHeldObject);
 *   - any value other than 0xFF: the craft is dying, so step its death sequence (stepDyingObjectState);
 *   - 0xFF (active): fly it -- turn toward its aim heading, fly one step, then either retire the slot
 *     (it has reached the retire line) or give it one gated launch attempt and redraw its sprite from
 *     its heading.
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. Index 1 of the per-era slot-service table at 0x2914 (ERA_INDEX & 7 == 1): the
 * era-1 member of the family serviceEra0/2/3/4EnemyCraftSlot, which share the same status ladder. The
 * era-1 specifics are the flight step (paced by the velocity table at 0x5E00, where era 0 uses
 * 0x5840) and the second era's sprite shapes and tint.
 *
 * PARAMETERS. `ix` is the slot's object record, `iy` its sprite entry.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory; on the refreshed path, the accumulator and flags the sprite refresh leaves.
