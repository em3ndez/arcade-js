/** launchBankEnemyWhenAimedNearPlayer — one gated attempt to launch an enemy into the object bank. Four gates guard it: a
 * phase key that only lets one bank phase through, an arm flag, a non-empty flight count, and a
 * free record in the bank being found by a strided upward scan. When all pass, three window tests
 * follow: the craft must NOT sit near the player's fixed screen position on both axes, its heading
 * must lie near the player's heading, and the heading toward the aim point must lie near its own;
 * only then
 * does it request the launch sound, copy the launching craft's (caller's) two coordinates into the found record's
 * paired entry, look a velocity pair up from the heading (one of two tables, chosen by a select
 * cell), stock the record with that velocity, stamp two entry constants, re-arm the flag from its
 * source, and count the record head down one. The scan cursors, the margin scratch and the found
 * pointers are JS locals; the two entry pointers ride in on ix/iy and are never disturbed, so both
 * stay seated as the only register live-outs (the sprite/steer callees downstream read them). The
 * heading passes into the velocity shims as an argument. LIVE-OUT: the found
 * record and its entry, the pointer cells, the arm flag; and ix/iy held. Nothing is returned. */

// ROM 0x3ED6-0x3F92, plus the detached block 0x3F9E-0x3FAE (lift: translated/loc_3ed6.js). Grounding
// tag in names.js ROUTINES: [seen].
//
// ROLE IN THE MACHINE. This is how an ordinary enemy craft FIRES at the player. Each era's per-slot
// craft handler (serviceEra0EnemyCraftSlot ... serviceEra4EnemyCraftSlot) calls it with IX/IY on that
// craft's record and sprite entry. The shot goes into one of the four enemy-shot slots
// (ACTOR_RECORD_SLOT0..3, 0xA810-0xA840, [seen]). Per mechanisms.md ("Enemy weapons and special
// craft, era by era") it fires only when: the craft is on its one-in-eight turn, BANK_LAUNCH_COOLDOWN
// has run out, one of the first BANK_LAUNCH_SLOT_COUNT shot slots is free, the craft is NOT within
// the near band of the player's fixed screen position on both axes, the craft's heading is within
// BANK_LAUNCH_HEADING_HALF_WIDTH of the player's heading, and the heading toward the aim point is within 16
// of the craft's own. The shot then starts at the craft and flies along that aim heading.
//
// PARAMETERS. `ixEntry` is the launching craft's record (the ROM's IX), `iyEntry` its sprite entry
// (IY). Every cell named below is tagged [seen] in names.js.
//
// THE WINDOW TEST used throughout below: for a half-width h, `(target - value) + h` taken as a byte is
// below 2h exactly when value lies within h of target (the wrap turns "too far either side" into one
// unsigned compare).
