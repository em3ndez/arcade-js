/** flyAlongHeadingAtDoubleVelocity — fly one object a DOUBLE step along the heading it holds, while the world scrolls
 * underneath it. The heading picks a pair of perpendicular components out of the speed table the
 * caller chose; each of the object's two coordinates then gains TWICE its own component plus the
 * per-frame displacement every object shares, which is added once rather than twice — so doubling
 * moves the object faster through the world without moving the world. Each coordinate is 16 bits
 * stored split, the whole part in the sprite entry and the fraction in the record, so a component
 * smaller than half a pixel still banks.
 *
 * ROM 0x58FE-0x5941 (frozen lift translated/loc_58fe.js). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x58fe).
 *
 * Role in the machine: the fast twin of flyAlongHeading. The two ROM bodies are byte-identical
 * except for two inserted `add hl,de` / `add hl,bc`, each placed right after a velocity term is
 * added and neither after the scroll load — which is why only the velocity doubles. Like its twin
 * it is entered only through two-instruction shims that fix a velocity table; names.js records it
 * dispatched in quantity only on a run holding the era at 4, and never in eras 0-1.
 *
 * `table` is the velocity table (HL on the Z80), `object` the record (IX), `sprite` the entry (IY).
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory only — the four coordinate bytes. */
