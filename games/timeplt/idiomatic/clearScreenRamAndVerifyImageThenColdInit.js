 * clearScreenRamAndVerifyImageThenColdInit — cold-start clear, then verify the program image and hand off to init.
 * Fills colour RAM with 0x10 and video RAM with 0xf1 (bases from two image pointers), then sums the
 * program image and subtracts the stored total: zero hands off to init. The fold covers the program image and
 * nothing else, so the total is a constant of the image and a genuine image always lands on zero. The other
 * arm jumps into a data table and runs it as code, which destroys control rather than reporting anything;
 * it has no faithful transcription, so it raises where it would derail.
 * LIVE-OUT: the two fills and the watchdog kicks (after fill one, then once per summed byte), then the handoff.
 *
 * ROM 0x5866-0x58A3, reached from 0x0069. [seen]
 *
 * Role in the machine: the third stage of the cold start (after power-on at 0x07B1 and the RAM clear
 * at 0x0069). The character plane's two 1 KB planes -- colour RAM at 0xA000 and video RAM at 0xA400
 * -- are each filled with one uniform value so the screen starts in a known pattern, then the whole
 * 24 KB program ROM is checked before the game is
 * allowed to initialise. A tampered image derails into data at 0x59D7 (names.js).
