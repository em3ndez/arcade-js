/** hasReachedRetireLine — true once an actor's screen position lands on a retire line.
 * One line per axis; a hit is the line or either neighbouring pixel, three values wide, which
 * lets a coordinate moving up to three pixels a frame land ON the line rather than step over
 * it. Both coordinates wrap at 256, so the window is a wrapped distance, not a range.
 * LIVE-OUT: the boolean, returned; memory and every register untouched.
 *
 * ROM 0x2B83-0x2B92 (frozen lift translated/loc_2b83.js). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x2b83:
 * "answer whether an actor has drifted onto either of two fixed retire lines, within a narrow wrapped
 * window, which is what makes its caller free the slot").
 *
 * Role in the machine: the common off-field test (mechanisms.md, "Retire lines and edge tests"). The
 * craft services, the chasers, the parachutist and serviceSlotByHeadByte all ask it; the callers that
 * act on a yes free the object's slot, though at least one path discards the answer (names.js "why").
 * Objects leave play by their SCREEN position -- the whole bytes of their sprite entry -- because the
 * world itself has no edge.
 *
 * Why these two lines: resetPlayfieldAndArmNewRound pins the player's own sprite entry at (0x84, 0x78)
 * and nothing that flies the ship moves it, so 0xF8 and 0x04 are each exactly 0x80 -- half the wrapping
 * coordinate range -- away from the player's: its antipode in a coordinate that wraps at 256 (names.js "why").
 *
 * Parameter: entry — the address of the actor's sprite entry; the ROM hands it in IY. The entry's +0
 * byte is its horizontal coordinate and its +0x31 byte its vertical one.
