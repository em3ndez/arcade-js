/** destroyTargetsHitByShots — destroy every target a live shot has reached, and post the score for each one.
 *
 * ROM 0x5211-0x5269. Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x5211).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. This is the shots-against-targets half of the round engine's collision pass
 * (mechanisms.md, "Shots against targets"). Every caller fixes the outer run at the six-record
 * player shot table (PLAYER_SHOT_ARRAY 0xAA80 [seen], the table fireAndSweepPlayerShots owns) and
 * varies only the inner run of targets -- so the sweep runs shots against targets, not the
 * reverse. stagePlayerShotSweepAgainstTargetsAndRun, for example, sweeps six shots against three
 * era-object slots with a reach of 7 and a span of 15, i.e. a box of 7 either side.
 *
 * A run of shot slots is swept against a run of target slots. A shot whose state byte does not
 * hold the live code is passed over entirely. A live one is tested against every target in the
 * run: the target must itself be live, neither of its two coordinates may lie in the narrow band
 * around zero that an unplaced or retired slot leaves behind, and both must fall inside a box
 * centred on the shot — one half-width and one width, from the caller, shared by both axes.
 * A target that passes is destroyed together with the shot that reached it: both state bytes take
 * the same destroyed code and the chained hit score is posted for that single kill. The sweep
 * does NOT stop there, so one shot can take several targets in one pass and is paid for each.
 * The two coordinate sources are parallel tables read at different strides: the shot keeps its
 * whole-part coordinates inside its own record, the target keeps them in a two-byte entry whose
 * halves sit 49 apart. Between passes the target cursors are RELOADED from two fixed cells and
 * the inner count from the shadow accumulator; none of the three is carried on, so every shot
 * starts the same run over.
 *
 * The destroyed code 0xF0 is not this routine's bookkeeping: it is the state stepDyingObjectState
 * turns into a death countdown before retiring the slot (names.js), and for a shot record the
 * shot sweep frees any head other than 0xFF on its next pass (mechanisms.md).
 *
 * PARAMETERS (where the values come from): shot = first shot record (the ROM's IX); entry = first
 * target sprite entry (IY); target = first target record (DE); targetsFirstPass / targetsPerPass =
 * the inner count for the first shot and for every later shot (B, and the shadow A'); shots = the
 * outer count (C); reach and span = the box half-width and width (L and H). The caller also seats
 * SCRATCH_PTR_A with the entry run start and SCRATCH_PTR_B with the record run start.
 * LIVE-OUT: memory only. */
