 * armBomberSlotWhenTimerFires — ROM 0x3C25 [seen]
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. The launch step of the 1940 era's middle-size bomber (the 1,500-point craft that dies on
 * the fourth hit, per mechanisms.md). Its sole caller, serviceEra1BomberObject (0x3B5F), runs only in
 * era 1 and dispatches here while the object's record head byte is 0 (idle). Per names.js this is
 * the bomber, not the Mother-Ship: it seeds the hit counter with three (it absorbs three hits and
 * dies on the fourth) where the Mother-Ship's is seeded with seven.
 *
 * ROLE. On even frames only, tick the slot's arming countdown; when it reaches zero and the
 * Mother-Ship is not already armed, arm the slot: pick a shape record from the player's heading,
 * snap the heading to a single facing bit, fetch the velocity pair for that facing, write shape,
 * facing and velocity into the slot, set the shared hit count, and mark the slot live.
 *
 * PARAMETERS: ix = the object's record (ERA_OBJECT_RECORD_SLOT0 0xA8C0 from the caller);
 * iy = its sprite entry (ERA_OBJECT_ENTRY_SLOT0 0xAA28).
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory.
