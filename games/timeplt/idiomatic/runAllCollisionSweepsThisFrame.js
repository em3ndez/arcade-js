 * runAllCollisionSweepsThisFrame — ROM 0x4E63 [seen]
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. One round-engine pass's full collision-and-destruction work. dispatchCollisionPassByEra
 * sends here on even FRAME_TICK values in eras 0, 2 and 3, and dispatchEra4CollisionByFrameParity on
 * even ticks in era 4 (mechanisms.md, collision). Every sweep compares positions in sprite entries
 * and, on a touch, writes the destroyed code 0xF0 into state bytes; the object handlers act on it
 * later in their own frames.
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. Six stages, in ROM order:
 *   1. the player's shots against the three-slot era weapon bank (stagePlayerShotSweepAgainstTargetsAndRun);
 *   2. the player against the four enemy-shot slots (destroyPlayerAndObjectsTouchingIt, unscored);
 *   3. the player against the craft band (destroySlotsAndPlayerOnContact, scored);
 *   4. only while the Mother-Ship is armed: the player against the Mother-Ship (ramTestPlayerVsMotherShip);
 *   5. the player against the era weapons (destroyTargetsReachedByFixedAttacker, scored);
 *   6. the parachutist pickup (markObjectsTouchingPlayer), the only contact that leaves the player alive.
 * Stages 2, 3, 5 and 6 share ONE cursor pair (a record cursor, 16-byte stride, and a sprite-entry
 * cursor, 2-byte stride -- the ROM's DE and IY), each sweep handing it on one past its last slot, so
 * together they walk the object array in address order: 0xA810 + 4 x 16 = 0xA850 (the craft band),
 * + 7 x 16 = 0xA8C0 (the era weapons), + 3 x 16 = 0xA8F0 (the parachutist). The pair now travels
 * through each callee's returned tuple rather than through registers. Every player sweep refuses
 * outright unless PLAYER_STATE reads 0xFF, and a refusing sweep hands the cursor back unmoved --
 * harmless, since then every later sweep refuses too.
 *
 * The small numbers passed to each sweep are the ROM's B, L and H loads -- a slot count and the two
 * box dimensions the callee measures a touch against (see each callee's own parameter list).
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory, plus the cursors the final mark leaves.
