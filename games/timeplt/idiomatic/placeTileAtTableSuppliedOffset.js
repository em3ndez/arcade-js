/** placeTileAtTableSuppliedOffset — carry an object onto one more sprite entry, offset from the one it already occupies
 * by an amount a table supplies. The entry one stride on takes one coordinate straight from the
 * register the caller loaded it into, and the other displaced by the byte the caller's pointer
 * selects — so the shape of the offset belongs to the table, not to any arithmetic here. Both
 * cursors then step onto the entry just written. LIVE-OUT: the two bytes and the stepped cursors.
 *
 * ROM 0x3074-0x307E (frozen lift translated/loc_3074.js). names.js has no ROUTINES entry for
 * 0x3074, so this entry carries no grounding tag of its own; its only caller is loc_307f
 * (0x307F) [code], the tail of a per-slot sprite-entry fill, which hands each slot here while
 * its counter (B) still holds — "the straight placer" in that entry's role text.
 *
 * Parameters, all supplied by loc_307f: `iy` is the sprite entry the object occupies now, `hl`
 * points at the table byte that sets the offset, `c` is the coordinate that offset is added to,
 * and `b` is the other coordinate, stored unchanged.
