 * serviceEra1BomberObject — one frame of the 1940 era's bomber.
 *
 * ROM 0x3B5F-0x3B76 (the live arm falls through into 0x3B77). Grounding: [seen]
 * (names.js ROUTINES 0x3b5f).
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. In era 1 (1940) the era-object bank carries a single large multi-hit craft, the bomber,
 * in its first slot (record ERA_OBJECT_RECORD_SLOT0 0xA8C0, sprite entry ERA_OBJECT_ENTRY_SLOT0
 * 0xAA28). The record's head byte says what state it is in, and this routine runs the matching step:
 *   - 0x00 (empty): count its arming timer, and arm a new bomber when it fires
 *     (armBomberSlotWhenTimerFires, 0x3C25);
 *   - 0xFF (live): the ordinary two-tile move, with a chance of an aimed spawn
 *     (advanceTwoTileObjectThenTryAimedSpawn, 0x3B77);
 *   - anything else: it has been hit, so spend its remaining hits and run it down toward death
 *     (advanceHitSoakingObjectThenAnimateDeath, 0x3B94).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. Called once per dispatch of the round engine's service list
 * (serviceRoundThenResolvePlayerState) alongside the other eras' object-bank services; it returns
 * untouched in every era but 1.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory.
