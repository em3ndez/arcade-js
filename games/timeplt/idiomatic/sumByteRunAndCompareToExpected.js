/** sumByteRunAndCompareToExpected — add a run of bytes together and answer whether the total is the one the caller
 * named. The run is walked forward from a pointer; the length arrives as a count that means a
 * full 256 when it is zero, and the total wraps at eight bits. Nothing is written, and both of
 * its exits are the same exit — the answer is left for the caller rather than acted on here.
 * The image's one caller reloads the accumulator, pointer, counter and flags before reading any,
 * so the total, walked pointer and spent count are not handed back.
 *
 * ROM 0x0B4C-0x0B53 (frozen lift translated/loc_0b4c.js). Grounding: [seen].
 *
 * Role in the machine: a simple eight-bit additive checksum, one of the game's anti-tamper
 * tripwires. Its one caller, seatEraSceneryRowThenClearAndRunScenery (ROM 0x30A5), sums the
 * sixteen bytes at 0x086B against 0x22 before seating the era's scenery row; names.js records that
 * check as a discarded tripwire. This routine only computes and compares.
 *
 * Parameters as the Z80 passed them: `base` in HL (first byte), `length` in B (a DJNZ count, so 0
 * means 256), `expected` in C (compared with `cp c`).
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: the answer, returned (the Z80's Z flag: set when the total matches). */
