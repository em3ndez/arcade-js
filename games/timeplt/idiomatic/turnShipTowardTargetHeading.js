/** turnShipTowardTargetHeading — turn the ship one notch toward a wanted heading, then scroll the world to match.
 * The wanted heading comes from a fixed table indexed by the value handed in. The live heading in
 * PLAYER_HEADING is left alone when it already matches, snapped on when one notch either side would
 * reach it, and otherwise stepped the short way round the compass by three notches — four once the
 * era's low digit reaches three. Control then falls into the shared world-scroll tail. LIVE-OUT: memory.
 *
 * ROM 0x1F01-0x1F41 (frozen lift translated/loc_1f01.js; the step arms sit at 0x1F68 and 0x1F6F),
 * falling into scrollWorldAtTheEraPace at 0x1F42. Grounding: [seen] in names.js.
 *
 * Role in the machine: this is how the player steers. In Time Pilot the ship never leaves the
 * centre of the screen; the joystick picks a direction, the ship rotates toward it a few heading
 * steps per call, and the world scrolls opposite the heading. dispatchPlayerFrameByState calls this while
 * the ship is alive, play is live and the stick is off centre.
 *
 * Parameter: `stick` is the low nibble of the control word readPlayerControls returned (non-zero —
 * a centred stick never reaches here). PLAYER_HEADING (0xA802) is a whole byte: 256 steps round the
 * circle, so heading arithmetic wraps naturally at eight bits. */
