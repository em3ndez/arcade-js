/** sweepObjectSlotBankByHead — sweep a fixed bank of object slots for a frame, servicing each occupied one. An empty
 * head (0) is left alone, a ballistic head (0xFF) is flown a frame along its arc, any other value is
 * a live countdown the shape-cycle service runs down; the cursor strides one record and two
 * sprite-entry bytes per slot, for the caller's count. LIVE-OUT: memory.
 *
 * ROM 0x3FF9-0x4016. Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x3ff9).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. In the ROM this is the loop head of the era-0 three-slot object bank
 * (mechanisms.md: "the loop head of the era-0 three-slot ballistic bank"). serviceEra0BallisticObjectBank
 * (0x3FEA) seats the cursors — record 0xA8C0 (ERA_OBJECT_RECORD_SLOT0), sprite entry 0xAA28
 * (ERA_OBJECT_ENTRY_SLOT0), count 3 — and its code runs straight on into 0x3FF9; the loop's `djnz`
 * at 0x4014 jumps back here for each further slot. The ROM also enters the same loop mid-way at 0x4008
 * (sweepObjectSlotBankServicingFirstSlot) and at 0x400B (advanceSlotThenSweepObjectBankByHead); in
 * this port those entries are their own routines, and this file is the whole loop entered at its head.
 *
 * WHAT A SLOT IS. Each slot is a 0x10-byte object record (the cursor the ROM keeps in IX) paired with
 * a two-byte sprite entry (the cursor in IY): per names.js runOneShotAnimatedObjectSlot, entry bytes
 * +0 and +0x31 hold the sprite's position (zeroed to retire it), +1 its shape and +0x30 its
 * attribute. Byte +0 of the record, the "head", says what the slot holds.
 *
 * PARAMETERS. `ix` / `iy` / `b` are the record cursor, sprite-entry cursor and slot count, defaulting
 * to the machine's IX, IY and B registers that the ROM caller seats before entering.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory (the serviced slots and sprite entries); IX and IY are written back to where the
 * cursors stopped (one stride past the last slot), and that pair is also returned.
