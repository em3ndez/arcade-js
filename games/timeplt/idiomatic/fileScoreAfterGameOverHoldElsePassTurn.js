 * ROM 0x330B-0x3347 (lift: translated/loc_330b.js). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x330B).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. Sub-step 8 of the play phase of the two-level sequence machine (entry 8 of
 * the 0x0F29 table, dispatched by dispatchSequenceSubStepArm). The step before it,
 * postGameOverBanner, put PLAYER n and GAME OVER on screen and armed SEQUENCE_DELAY with 180 frames
 * (mechanisms.md, "Filing (step 8)"), so the first thing this step does is hold that banner.
 *
 * While the delay is still counting it just ticks. When it expires and the score beats no standing
 * record, two commands are queued, the sub-step is reseated from a program byte and the turn passes
 * on (or the sequence steps). When the score was filed, a sound is requested, the pen is set to the
 * blanking glyph and armed at its route start, a fixed 256-byte program run is folded into an
 * eight-bit total -- any total but the genuine one advances the outer phase -- and the sub-step
 * steps on, to sub-step 9, the start of initials entry.
 * LIVE-OUT: memory. */
