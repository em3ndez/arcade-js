/** requestTwoSounds — request two sounds in a row, both admitted while a game is in progress or while the
 * cabinet may sound during its attract loop. Neither code is an immediate: each is fetched from
 * its own byte of the program image, and the two bytes are far apart, so this is a pair chosen
 * here and not a run walked through. LIVE-OUT: memory.
 *
 * ROM 0x5683-0x568D. Grounding: [seen].
 *
 * Role in the machine: the sound pair for combat impacts. Its callers
 * (advanceHitSoakingObjectThenAnimateDeath, countTheKillAndGrantTheSharedToken,
 * stampObjectStateByte3bThenRequestTwoSounds, loc_43f0) are hit, kill and retire sites,
 * which is why the first code is named generically rather than "death". Both
 * codes go onto the shared sound queue; the queue's drain at 0x55D4 later takes each head code and
 * hands it to 0x55F8, which writes it to 0xC000 -- the sound-data latch -- and pulses the LS259
 * bit wired to the second (audio) Z80's interrupt, so these bytes end up as commands to another
 * processor rather than sitting in RAM.
 *
 * Twin: requestTwoSoundsWhilePlaying has the same two-fetch shape but goes through the
 * play-only door; this one uses the play-or-demo door, so the demo hears it too.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory only -- the sound queue, up to two entries. */
