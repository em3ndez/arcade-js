 * chaseOneAimPointAndRetireAtTheLine — ROM 0x4117 [seen]
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. One frame of the "chase" behaviour for a single enemy object: it homes in on a point
 * near the player's ship and is freed once it drifts onto a retire line. The object-bank sweep runs
 * it for a live slot whose countdown at +0x0E has run out.
 *
 * ROLE. Re-aim, turn, move, dress the sprite, retire at the line. Re-aiming is RATIONED rather than
 * done every frame: the object carries a phase byte and the aim is recomputed only on frames whose
 * low four bits match it, which spreads a crowd's cost across sixteen frames and leaves each object
 * a stale aim in between (a phase byte above 15 never matches, so such an object is never
 * re-aimed). The turn, the move and the dressing run every frame regardless.
 *
 * The aim point read is ENEMY_STANDOFF_AIM_MAIN (0xAC7F), one of SIX two-byte points packed at
 * 0xAC74-0xAC7F that layOutEnemyAimPointsFromScrollAngle rewrites as a block each pass -- so it is
 * ONE point, not THE point, and neither the only one nor fixed. The sibling at 0x41B8 has the same
 * shape but aims at other points of that block.
 *
 * PARAMETERS: object = the object's record (IX in the ROM); sprite = its sprite entry (IY).
 * LIVE-OUT: memory.
