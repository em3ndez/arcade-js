/** drawSlotWithOneGlyph — write one caller-supplied glyph into the cell the cursor names, blank
 * the cell one place BACK from it, give both of those cells the caller's colour, and step the
 * cursor on to the next slot. Crossing into the colour plane and back is done by clearing and
 * then SETTING one bit of the address, so a cursor that has drifted off its own plane is snapped
 * onto it rather than returned to where it came from. LIVE-OUT: the four cells written, and the
 * stepped cursor handed back through retreatCharCursor.
 *
 * ROM 0x0E8D-0x0E9B (frozen lift translated/loc_0e8d.js). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. One of three slot painters that step the same character cursor by the same
 * amount: paintDoubleTile fills both cells of a two-cell slot with glyphs, paintQuadTile writes
 * four, and this one uses only one cell and blanks the other half (0xF1). Among its callers is
 * drawCountAsPictogramStrip, which lays a row of such slots. The blank is the unused half of a
 * fixed-width slot, not leading-zero suppression.
 *
 * THE TWO PLANES. The board's character RAM is a glyph plane at 0xA400-0xA7FF and a colour plane
 * 0x400 below it at 0xA000-0xA3FF, cell for cell; so clearing address bit 0x400 (the ROM's
 * `res 2,h`) moves from a glyph cell to its colour cell and setting it (`set 2,h`) moves back.
 *
 * Parameters: `cell` is the cursor (the ROM's DE), `glyph` the glyph to show (B) and `colour` the
 * colour for both cells (C).
