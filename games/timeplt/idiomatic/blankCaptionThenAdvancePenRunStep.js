/**
 * blankCaptionThenAdvancePenRunStep — a sequence arm that blanks a fixed caption run and advances the
 * interpolated pen run; once the run has finished (reseated to a zero row integer) it runs two
 * anti-tamper folds and steps the sequence on.
 *
 * ROM 0x5BD7-0x5BFF. Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x5BD7).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. Entry 2 of the sub-step arm table at 0x0F29, dispatched by
 * dispatchSequenceSubStepArm. Like advancePenRunAnimationStep it is re-entered frame after frame: each
 * frame re-blanks the caption run and draws one more pen run, and only the frame on which the pen run
 * reseats to row zero goes on to the checks and steps SEQUENCE_SUBSTEP [seen].
 *
 * THE TWO FOLDS (both checked against the ROM image; on a genuine image neither changes anything):
 *   1. XOR of the 256 program bytes at 0x0BDD must be 0x1C; any other value advances the outer sequence
 *      phase (advanceSequencePhase, ROM 0x0F11) — the machine is thrown into another mode.
 *   2. SEQUENCE_PHASE [seen] plus the 20 program bytes at 0x1734 (the first bytes of
 *      advancePenRunAnimationStep, read as data) plus 0x77 is written back to SEQUENCE_PHASE. Those bytes sum
 *      to 0x89 and 0x89 + 0x77 wraps to 0, so a genuine image leaves the phase as it was; an altered one
 *      shifts it.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory.
