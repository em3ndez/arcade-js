/** retireSlotIntoSharedCooldown — take the caller's slot out of play and stock its record byte (index 14) from the

 *
 * ROM 0x3DFB-0x3E04 (frozen lift translated/loc_3dfb.js). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES
 * 0x3dfb). Role in the machine: the retire path of serviceSlotByHeadByte, which retires its slot
 * straight into this shared cooldown (mechanisms.md). It differs from retireSlotIntoCooldown,
 * which loads the same record byte with a fixed 240: here the value comes from one address that
 * six sites read and whose value moves over a game — 0x1E through the attract demo, then 0x42,
 * 0x48 and 0x4E across a driven game, restamped per era (names.js).
 *
 * `record` is the slot's record (IX) and `entry` its sprite entry (IY).
