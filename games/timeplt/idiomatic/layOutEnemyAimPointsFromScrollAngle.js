/** layOutEnemyAimPointsFromScrollAngle — when the mode byte in C selects sub-mode 7, lay a sprite object's twelve coordinate
 * fields (0x10-0x1b) out as six XY pairs around centre (0x78 across, 0x84 down): the scroll angle
 * turned a quarter and the scroll angle itself, each drawn through the velocity table at an x8 and an
 * x16 radius, the quarter-turned direction also mirrored to its negatives; every other sub-mode
 * returns without a write.
 *
 * ROM 0x326C-0x32EA (lift: translated/loc_326c.js). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x326C).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. Enemy re-aim code steers toward aim points (mechanisms.md, record +1);
 * this routine lays a set of those points out around the ship's fixed screen position. Its caller
 * is reaimAndAnimateEnemyCraftOnPhaseTick, which runs first in each round-engine dispatch and
 * passes the low place of the life tick counter (LIFE_TICKS_LOW 0xAD05 [seen]) as the mode byte.
 * That byte is packed decimal, so "low nibble == 7" means "units digit 7": on those passes (and
 * not on the 00-09 / 30-39 passes that re-aim a craft instead) the points are laid out from the
 * heading as it stood before this dispatch's turn (mechanisms.md, round engine order).
 *
 * The "scroll angle" in the name is PLAYER_HEADING 0xA802 [seen]: the world scroll is the negated
 * ship velocity (names.js WORLD_SCROLL_Y), so the ship's heading also fixes the scroll direction. The fields are written from ENEMY_AIM_ANCHOR_Y 0xAC64 [seen], the enemy aim anchor.
 *
 * PARAMETER: c = the mode byte (the ROM's C, which the caller loaded from LIFE_TICKS_LOW).
 * LIVE-OUT: fields 0x10-0x1b of that object; no return value. */
