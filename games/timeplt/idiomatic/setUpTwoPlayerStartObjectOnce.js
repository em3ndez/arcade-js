/** setUpTwoPlayerStartObjectOnce — fire once when a watched pair of cells stops agreeing: step a shared counter down,
 * seat two vertical bytes and two glyph bytes into one object slot, ask for a sound when the trigger
 * cell is armed, and queue one display command. When the pair still agrees it does nothing.
 * LIVE-OUT: memory.
 *
 * ROM 0x460E-0x4645. Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x460e).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. startTwoPlayerGame runs this at a two-player start. The pair it watches is
 * an anti-tamper witness: TAMPER_GLYPH_COPY 0xAB43 [seen] holds a copy of the glyph (0x7C) taken
 * earlier from the character cell TAMPER_GLYPH_SOURCE_CELL 0xA67C, and a genuine image keeps the
 * two equal. Under MAME both held 0x7C at every captured two-player start, so the routine returned
 * without acting (mechanisms.md). What the acting arm is for -- which counter and which slot the
 * caller's pointers name there -- is recorded as open in mechanisms.md; mechanisms.md reads it as
 * replaying a fragment of the Mother-Ship warp's bookkeeping.
 *
 * PARAMETERS: counterBase, slotBase = the pointers the acting arm steps and seats through (the ROM's
 * IX and IY). The ROM's caller never loads either: at the one dispatch the tapes reach (the
 * two-player start, via startTwoPlayerGame) the oracle arrived with IX = 0x3010, a ROM address, and
 * IY = 0xAA18, left there by earlier routines. A direct caller therefore has no pointer to give and
 * passes null for both; the acting arm then refuses rather than invent one. A register-dispatched
 * caller in the frozen layer reaches it with whatever the registers hold, as the ROM does.
