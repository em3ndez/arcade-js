/** armAttractScreenShowingHighScore — arm a fresh screen once a per-frame countdown lapses. Every call first ticks that
 * countdown; the rest runs only on the call that zeroes it — push four fixed commands onto the ring,
 * seed a marker into two cells, patch six cells from the record list that follows this routine (each
 * destination gets a value with a marker beside it), print the six-digit readout, set two sub-state
 * cells, and push a fifth command only when the gate cell is non-zero. LIVE-OUT: memory.
 *
 * ROM 0x15FE-0x163E (frozen lift translated/loc_15fe.js); its patch list follows at 0x163F.
 * Grounding: [seen] in names.js.
 *
 * Role in the machine: an arm of the attract sequence. The countdown it ticks is a screen wipe —
 * blankNextLine (0x01C2) blanks one line of the character plane per call and counts the lines still
 * owed — so the new screen is only drawn once the old one has been wiped clean. The screen it
 * builds shows the high score: captions posted to the command ring, a pair of marker glyphs, six
 * patched cells and the high-score digits. */
