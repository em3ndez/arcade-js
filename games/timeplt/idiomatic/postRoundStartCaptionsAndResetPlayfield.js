/** postRoundStartCaptionsAndResetPlayfield — round-start sequence arm: verify a fixed program span, post the round-start caption
 * commands, repaint the kill meter, reset the playfield for the new round, and step the sequence
 * sub-index.
 * The span is XOR-folded; any total but the genuine one advances the outer sequence phase first.
 * With play inactive a single default caption pair is posted. With play active the player caption
 * goes up (its argument one higher while the second player is up), followed by the same argument
 * under a second command when the round is armed, else by the default pair.
 * LIVE-OUT: memory only. */

/*
 * ROM 0x0774-0x07AC, grounding [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x0774).
 *
 * ROLE. The game is run by a two-level sequence machine: an outer phase (SEQUENCE_PHASE) and an inner
 * sub-step (SEQUENCE_SUBSTEP) that indexes a word table of "arms". This is entry 4 of the phase-3
 * (round engine) table at 0x0F29: the one-frame arm that opens a round -- in real play and in the
 * attract demo alike. It posts the captions shown before the round begins, repaints the kill meter,
 * resets the whole playfield, and steps the sub-step so the next frame runs the next arm.
 *
 * CAPTIONS. Text is not drawn here: postCommand (RST 0x38, 0x0038) queues a (command, argument) pair
 * in the command ring and the ring is drawn later, outside the interrupt. Command 2 is
 * drawCaptionInPenColour and command 7 drawRoundNumberCaption (command table 0x0BBC); caption records
 * 2, 9 and 10 in the 0x0C50 table read as " READY ", "PLAYER 1" and "PLAYER 2" (the glyph text is a
 * code-level reading, per names.js).
