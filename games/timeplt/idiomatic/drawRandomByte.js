/** drawRandomByte — draw the next pseudo-random byte. A block of seventeen bytes is a shift
 * register: each byte moves one place along and the vacated head takes the exclusive-or of two taps
 * read AFTER the shift, so the feedback is over the bytes that were seventh and sixteenth. What is
 * handed back is that feedback PLUS the free-running frame counter, so two draws at different
 * moments differ even where the register has not moved. The register IS the state and every draw
 * advances it.
 *
 * ROM 0x4B4B-0x4B66 (frozen lift translated/loc_4b4b.js). Grounding: [seen] -- a MAME write tap on
 * the register found exactly two writers: this routine's feedback store and the seeder's block copy
 * (names.js).
 *
 * Role in the machine: the game's only random generator. RANDOM_REGISTER (0xAB30) is seeded by
 * seedRandomRegister from seventeen fixed program bytes at 0x4B84, at cold start and again at the
 * start of every attract demo (mechanisms.md "The random generator"). Its four callers --
 * driveEnemyWaveForLifePhase, spawnEnemyWaveIntoFreeSlots, spawnEnemyIntoFreeSlotElseStepSearch
 * and pickScriptAtRandomOrInTurn -- each use the draw at once and shape it differently. The ROM
 * brackets the body with `exx`, so the caller's main registers survive; only A carries the draw.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: the drawn byte, returned, plus the shifted block in memory. */
