/** holdCopyrightThenEraseTheCoinInvitation — hold one sequence step for as long as its delay cell counts, restamping the
 * copyright caption and flashing its line on every frame of the wait, then leave the step.
 *
 * ROM 0x1748-0x1769 (lift: translated/loc_1748.js). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x1748).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. Step 4 of sequence phase 1, the attract cycle
 * (dispatchSequencePhase1SubStepArm, inner index 4; mechanisms.md "Step 4"). The screen invites a coin; this step holds it, then
 * erases the invitation -- caption records 3 and 4, PLEASE DEPOSIT COIN and AND TRY THIS GAME --
 * while the copyright line it has been restamping stays.
 *
 * The delay comes down by one per frame and nothing else happens until it reaches zero, so the
 * step lasts as many frames as the cell held on arrival — and a cell holding zero on arrival
 * wraps to 255 and waits the long way round rather than leaving at once (after power-on that is
 * what happens: a 256-frame hold, mechanisms.md). On the frame it expires, one cell of the caption
 * is sampled from both planes and the pair kept aside, two commands go out to the ring, and the
 * sequence moves on to its next step.
 * LIVE-OUT: memory only. */
