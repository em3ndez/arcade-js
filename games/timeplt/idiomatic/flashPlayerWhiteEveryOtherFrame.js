/** flashPlayerWhiteEveryOtherFrame — one frame of an animation that flips a sprite entry's colour field between two
 * values as its own tick counter alternates, leaving the top two bits of that byte — the pair the
 * shape's mirroring lives in — exactly as they were. On the one tick where the counter reads the
 * threshold it also moves the step cell on and asks for a sound; every other tick only recolours.
 * The counter is stepped last and wraps at eight bits.
 *
 * ROM 0x1367-0x1392 (lift: translated/loc_1367.js). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x1367).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. The first part of the between-eras band animation that plays after a round
 * is won: stepRoundStartIntroAnimation dispatches on INTRO_ANIMATION_STEP 0xA9F0 [seen] and runs
 * this for its flash steps, running the player's ship white and back (mechanisms.md, round won).
 * The byte recoloured is PLAYER_SPRITE_ATTRIBUTE 0xAA40 [seen], the player's sprite colour + flip
 * byte, which the sprite publisher copies to the hardware. Under MAME the ship's pixels were seen
 * alternating white and blue frame by frame (names.js ROUTINES 0x1367, "why").
 * LIVE-OUT: memory. */
