/** awardScoreToPlayer — the score-award command: add the award the argument picks to the current player's
 * packed-decimal score, lift that score into the high score when it now beats it, and repaint the
 * scores it touched. A zero argument takes a separate arm that only (re)paints the score labels
 * and, in a one-player game, blanks the absent second score. A flag can veto the whole command.
 * LIVE-OUT: memory.
 *
 * ROM 0x0C90-0x0D1A (frozen lift translated/loc_0c90.js). Grounding: [seen] in names.js.
 *
 * Role in the machine: this is handler 4 of the command ring. A kill is scored by posting command 4
 * with an award id (rst 0x38; advanceHitSoakingObjectThenAnimateDeath is one such poster), and the
 * foreground ring drain later runs this routine with that id as `award`. Each player's score is three packed-BCD bytes stored
 * LOW byte first (PLAYER1_SCORE_LO 0xAD33, PLAYER2_SCORE_LO 0xAD36), which is the order the
 * decimal add walks them; ACTIVE_PLAYER (0xAD32) chooses which one. The single displayed high score
 * ends at HIGH_SCORE_HI (0xA98D), its most significant byte. */
