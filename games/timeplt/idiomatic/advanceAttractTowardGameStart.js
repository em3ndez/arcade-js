 * advanceAttractTowardGameStart — ROM 0x0F54 [seen]
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. The fixed continuation of the round-engine phase's sequence step. Time Pilot runs its
 * top level as a two-level sequence machine: SEQUENCE_PHASE (0xA9AB) is the outer mode (0 boot wipe,
 * 1 attract, 2 credit / push-start, 3 round engine) and SEQUENCE_SUBSTEP (0xA9AC) the step inside
 * it. For phase 3, dispatchSequenceSubStepArm (0x0F1F) runs the arm the sub-step selects and then
 * ALWAYS continues here. Phase 3 is also what the attract demo runs, so this is the point where a
 * demo notices that a credit has arrived (or that free play and a start button allow a game).
 *
 * ROLE. Three outcomes, tested in order:
 *   1. a game is already being played -> nothing to do;
 *   2. there is a credit -> leave the demo for the credit / push-start phase;
 *   3. free play is on and a start button is held -> clear the picture's sprites and start a game.
 * The free-play arm was not observed under MAME (names.js); it is read from the ROM.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory only; the accumulator and flags the original leaves on each bail are read by
 * nothing after it.
