/** commissionStagedAttackerByEra — commission the object the slot-finder staged, whose record and paired-entry pointers
 * wait in two fixed cells. Copies the spawner's two coordinate pairs and the caller's facing byte
 * across into the new slot, then fits it out one of four ways chosen by the current era: era zero
 * an unaimed drift with a mirror flag and a slow-fall marker; eras one and two a heading toward a
 * fixed screen point skewed by a stored half-turn; era three a velocity vector for a heading
 * offset a fixed step either side of the facing; era four a straight aim at that same point, with
 * one extra byte seeded. Every way winds the new slot's active count down, re-arms the spawn
 * cooldown, and hands off to one era-specific sound request. The staged record/entry pointers ride
 * in JS locals and are handed to each callee as arguments, so the spawner's own index registers are
 * never moved and stand at the spawner throughout. LIVE-OUT: memory; the two index registers, left
 * at the spawner; and whatever the sound request leaves. */

// ROM 0x42B7-0x43B6 (lift: translated/loc_42b7.js). Grounding tag in names.js ROUTINES: [seen].
//
// ROLE IN THE MACHINE. The era weapon bank (ERA_OBJECT_RECORD_SLOT0-2, 0xA8C0-0xA8E0) holds a
// different kind of enemy weapon in each era (mechanisms.md, "Enemy weapons and special craft, era by
// era"). An enemy that is allowed to launch one first has a free slot found for it:
// launchAttackerIntoFreeSlot (0x4243) walks the bank and parks the free slot's record pointer in
// SCRATCH_PTR_A (0xA991) and its sprite-entry pointer in SCRATCH_PTR_B (0xA993), then either comes here
// directly or goes through setTheLaunchFacingInsideOneAimWindow (0x429C), which transfers here in turn.
// This routine turns that empty slot into a live weapon: it starts it at the launcher's position and
// gives it the heading, velocity, look and timers its era calls for.
//
// PARAMETERS. `spawnerRecord` / `spawnerEntry` are the LAUNCHING object's record and sprite entry (the
// ROM's IX / IY on entry); `facing` (the ROM's C) is the heading the caller chose for the launch.
// The ROM pushes IX/IY, loads them with the new slot, and pops them back before its tail; here the
// new slot's pointers are simply locals.
//
// LIVE-OUT: memory -- the new slot's record and sprite entry, ATTACKER_SPAWN_COOLDOWN, and the sound
// request. Every cell named below is tagged [seen] in names.js.
