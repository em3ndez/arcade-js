/** steerTowardAimAtFixedRate — turn one object a step nearer the heading it is aiming at. It does nothing on one
 * frame in four. Both the standing test and the direction test are taken on the gap PLUS ONE
 * rather than on the gap, so it turns the shorter way round everywhere except at a gap of exactly
 * one short of a half turn, where the offset tips it to the longer side. The offset also leaves
 * the standing band two gaps wide and off centre — the aim reached exactly, and the aim one step
 * behind it — which is what stops it hunting. Because the heading moves in TWOS across a band of
 * two, which of the two it comes to rest on follows the parity of the gap and not the side it came
 * from: an even gap ends with the heading on the aim, an odd one with the aim one step behind, for
 * good.
 *
 * ROM 0x421F-0x4242 (frozen lift translated/loc_421f.js). Grounding: [seen].
 *
 * Role in the machine: the turning half of an enemy's homing. Its caller
 * (flyTowardShipStandoffThenEndApproach) re-aims by writing the object's aim byte every sixteenth
 * frame, calls this, and then calls the flier, whose first act is to read the heading byte this
 * routine just wrote — so the heading here is the one the object's motion follows. Under MAME it
 * did not run in eras 0-1 and ran thousands of times with the era held at 4. Its sibling steerTowardAimOneUnitAFrame is the same biased test with
 * a step of one and no frame gate.
 *
 * `object` is the object's sixteen-byte record (IX on the Z80): +1 the aim heading, +2 the current
 * heading, both on a 256-step circle.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory only — the one heading byte. */
