/** requestEnemyLaunchSound — request one particular sound, and only while a game is in progress. Its code is

 * Role in the machine: the sound of an enemy being launched. Its callers are
 * spawnAimedEnemyIntoEraBankWhenInWindow, stepMotherShip, and requestEraKeyedLaunchSound — the
 * last picks this code in the first three eras (ERA_INDEX 0-2) and its sibling
 * requestEnemyLaunchSoundLateEra from the fourth era on (ERA_INDEX 3 and 4).
 *
 * The code is ENEMY_LAUNCH_SOUND (0x07A2), a byte of the program ROM read as data, not an
 * immediate operand. It goes through enqueueSoundIfGameInProgress, so it is queued only while
 * PLAY_ACTIVE is set — the attract demo launches enemies silently.
