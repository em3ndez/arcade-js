/** stepSequenceUnderChecksum — step the sequence's inner sub-step on, folding a block of the
 * program image on the way; a total that does not match advances the outer phase instead, which
 * derails the sequence rather than halting it.
 *
 * ROLE. The game's top level is a sequence machine: an outer phase and an inner sub-step, each
 * sub-step a routine picked from a word table. This routine is one such step -- the eleventh entry
 * of the word table at 0x1659 that dispatchSequencePhase1SubStepArm dispatches; it has no static
 * call site anywhere in the image. Besides stepping on, it is an anti-tamper check: it adds up a
 * block of the program image and compares the total with a byte stored elsewhere in the image. The
 * block (256 bytes from 0x0BCC), the value the running total starts from (0x89) and where the
 * expected total is read from (0x1A50) are ALL fixed, so on an unaltered image the comparison has
 * one answer and only one arm can run -- under MAME the mismatch call at 0x4B2A is never taken.
 * The other arm neither stops nor reports: it advances the sequence PHASE (a different cell from
 * the sub-step), so a patched image quietly derails the sequence rather than halting.
 *
 * ROM 0x4B19-0x4B2F (frozen lift translated/loc_4b19.js). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES
 * 0x4b19). LIVE-OUT: the sub-step, plus the phase.
