//
// ROLE IN THE MACHINE. Every enemy-craft record starts with a state byte: 0x00 free, 0xFE held, 0xFF
// flying, and ANY OTHER value means the craft is dying and the value is its death countdown. The five
// per-era craft services (serviceEra0EnemyCraftSlot .. serviceEra4EnemyCraftSlot) hand that last case
// here, once per turn. A collision sweep marks a hit object by writing 0xF0 into its state byte, and
// this routine turns the mark into a countdown. It is also WHERE A KILL IS COUNTED: only the seven
// craft slots reach it, and countTheKillAndGrantTheSharedToken is what requests the death sounds and
// takes one off KILLS_REMAINING, the quota that brings on the Mother-Ship (mechanisms.md).
//
// The countdown values 0x3C and above (other than 0xF0) are written by the Mother-Ship's field sweep,
// which gives each swept craft a staggered code so they go down one after another.
//
// `object` is the craft's record (ix) and `sprite` its sprite entry (iy), as the craft service passes them.
// LIVE-OUT: memory -- the state byte, and whatever the kill count, the flight step, the move or the
// retire writes.
