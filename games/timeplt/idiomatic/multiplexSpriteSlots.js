/** multiplexSpriteSlots — give eight display-list slots a second appearance half a screen away: where
 * a slot's request bit (high bit of its first byte) is set, the pair trades half a byte range so the
 * slot moves to the far half; a slot with no request is untouched. Each relocation is recorded in
 * m.beamPlan so the beam-sync render can repaint the first appearance in its band. LIVE-OUT: memory, m.beamPlan.
 *
 * ROM 0x1098-0x1198 (frozen lift translated/loc_1098.js): eight identical 32-byte blocks, one per
 * scenery sprite. Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x1098: "wait until the raster has passed each of
 * eight scenery slots, then move that slot half a screen in both axes so the same sprite shows twice in
 * one frame; a slot whose request bit is clear is left alone").
 *
 * Role in the machine: 24 hardware sprites are not enough for the player, the enemies and the clouds,
 * so the eight scenery-fed sprites (hardware sprites 0-2 and 19-23) are each shown twice per frame by
 * moving them while the picture is being scanned out (mechanisms.md, sprite doubling). The request is
 * bit 7 of the sprite's Y byte in hardware bank 1, set by publishSpriteShadow's copy. This is the
 * CLOSING, waiting pass: the round engine (serviceRoundThenResolvePlayerState) and the two pre-round
 * lead-in arms run it at the end of their service lists, after the opportunistic passes of
 * multiplexSpriteSlotsSkipping.
 *
 * The wait: in the ROM each block spins on SCANLINE_COUNTER (0xC000), adding the request byte to it
 * until the sum carries out of eight bits -- until the raster has reached the line that depends on
 * where the sprite sits -- and then trades, so the first appearance is already drawn when the sprite
 * moves. This port does not spin on a raster; it makes every requested trade at once and records it
 * in m.beamPlan (opened by the machine's startBeamFrame) for the beam-sync render instead. The bytes
 * that land in memory are the ROM's.
