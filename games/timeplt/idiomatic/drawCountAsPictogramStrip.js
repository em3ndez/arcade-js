 * drawCountAsPictogramStrip — paint a count (clamped to 99) as a strip of tally blocks, like roman
 * numerals: thirties and tens as four-tile blocks, fives as two-tile blocks, ones as single glyphs.
 * Then check three words of the program image and reset the machine if they do not add up.
 *
 * ROM 0x0DD7-0x0E6F. Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x0DD7).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. The handler for drawing command 6 on the command ring — the queue of drawing
 * jobs the foreground loop executes. When a turn begins, loadActivePlayerContextAndPostRoundHud
 * [seen] posts command 6 with ROUND_NUMBER, so this is the round (stage) indicator on the HUD; the
 * high-score attract screen posts it with 1. The strip occupies the character-plane cells from
 * COUNT_PICTOGRAM_STRIP_START (0xA463) up to EMBLEM_STRIP_FLOOR (0xA623); the emblem strip grows
 * toward it from the other end of the same band.
 *
 * PARAMETER. `a` is the count the ring command carried.
 *
 * THE IMAGE CHECK. Like many Time Pilot routines this one carries an anti-tamper test on the program
 * image: three fixed low-ROM words (at 0x009D, 0x00A0, 0x00A3 — code bytes read as data) are added,
 * the two bytes of the sum folded together, and the result must come to 0x69. On a genuine image it
 * always does, so the failure arm is dead code; a patched image jumps to the reset vector.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: the painted strip (glyphs and colours); on a failed check, control goes to the reset
 * vector and never returns.
