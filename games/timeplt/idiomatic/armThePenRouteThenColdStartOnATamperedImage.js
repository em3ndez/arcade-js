 * armThePenRouteThenColdStartOnATamperedImage — put the tracing pen back at the start of its
 * route, then check the program image and cold-start on a tampered one.
 *
 * ROM 0x01E1-0x0200 (loc_01e1). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x01E1).
 *
 * What it is: some captions are drawn by a "pen" — a cursor that walks a fixed L-shaped route one
 * leg at a time, interpolating toward each leg's target and stamping a character cell at every
 * step (drawInterpolatedPenRun moves it, plotPenCell stamps). Three cells hold where it has got
 * to: PEN_ROUTE_LEG (0xA9E2) [seen], the leg it is on, and PEN_ROW_POS (0xA9E3) [seen] and
 * PEN_COLUMN_POS (0xA9E5) [seen], each an 8.8 fixed-point word — a whole-cell index in the high
 * byte and a fraction below it. This entry sends the pen back to leg zero at the route's first
 * point.
 *
 * The first point is not a literal: each coordinate is lifted from a fixed pair of program bytes
 * (PEN_ROUTE_START_ROW 0x0D45 = 0x1000, PEN_ROUTE_START_COLUMN 0x280C = 0x0400, i.e. row 0x10,
 * column 0x04 — the same point as entry zero, `10 04`, of the leg table at 0x0290), so the
 * route's start moves with the image.
 *
 * Then the anti-tamper check: a fixed 256-byte run of the image from PEN_ROUTE_CHECKSUM_BASE
 * (0x0E33) is summed into one eight-bit total and compared with 0xFD. The run lies wholly inside
 * the program image and holds neither seed word nor the leg table, so the total is a constant of
 * the image: a genuine image always gives 0xFD and the mismatch arm is dead. The arming above is
 * unconditional — the check gates nothing that came before it.
 *
 * On a tampered image the ROM calls the cold start at 0x0069, which clears 48 bytes of the second
 * sprite bank and all of work RAM (0xA800-0xAFFF, where the stack sits) and ends `jp 0x5866`,
 * never returning to this caller. That restart is not modelled as a call from inside a
 * frame, so here the mismatch arm raises instead.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory only — the three pen cells.
