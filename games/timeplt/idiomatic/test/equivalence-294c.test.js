 * serviceEra1EnemyCraftSlot — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x294C, run through the dispatch seam so SP
 * and pc are compared for equality. GATE: the undriven attract run is what reaches this arm (the era
 * index turns to 1 there; the coin-start tape holds era 0 and never dispatches it), so every real
 * dispatch of an attract replay is compared, plus capped buckets of every status class the run
 * presents -- empty, active, retiring (active and reaching the line), held, dying -- all REAL entries.
 * A second session reaches it on the played game: the coin-start tape with the era cell held at 1 by a
 * poke, so the game dispatches this arm through its own code; every dispatch of it is compared too.
 * Registers: ix and iy are HELD on every entry, compared for equality. The scratch registers the
 * frozen body leaves -- the accumulator and flags the sprite refresh (0x2A47) leaves on the active
 * path, and what the tested byte and the helpers leave on the others -- are a measured CEILING, not
 * compared. That they are dead is asked of the ORACLE, not argued: DEAD AT EXIT complements every
 * register in the ceiling on the frozen game at every exit of this entry, over the attract session
 * and the era-held coin-start session, and not one frame of state changes, while the same
 * instrument hears SP moved at the same exit and the record register shifted on the refresh's way
 * in. The rewrite's refresh writes no register at all, so a twin leaving the wrong accumulator is
 * HARMLESS and is asserted caught nowhere. Teeth: broken twins, each caught exactly where its
 * bug shows. SPLIT: the slot handed in as arguments is the slot worked on even when the registers
 * name a different one -- asserted on every class.
 * HOLE: the unpoked coin-start tape holds era 0 and never dispatches this arm; its played-game
 * coverage is the era-held session, which reaches era 1 by a poke rather than by play.
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-294c.test.js
