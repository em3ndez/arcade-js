/**
 * destroyMotherShipAndShotOnMutualHit — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x4FE0.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. A sweep of six slots to see which one a single roaming thing has reached: both must be
 * live, and both coordinates must fall inside a box whose first axis is widened by two of the era
 * values. A slot that passes is destroyed with the roamer and the chained hit score is posted for it.
 * That score routine is ALREADY decompiled, so the rewrite calls postChainedHitScore directly —
 * dissolving that call belongs to this caller's unit.
 *
 * ★ NO TAPE REACHES THIS ENTRY, and the UNREACHED arm asserts it: shared, attract and a turning tape
 *   each dispatch it ZERO times — the arm above sends control the other way. So the corpus here is REAL
 *   MACHINE STATES sampled at dispatches of the routine this entry is the tail of; every arm below is a
 *   crafted entry on one, and nothing here claims a natural dispatch.
 *
 * ★ THE FROZEN LAYER TRANSCRIBES THIS BODY TWICE — once standalone, once inside the routine that falls
 *   into it — so the oracle this file compares against is the standalone one, the only one the registry
 *   can dispatch.
 *
 * HOLE: no whole-machine arm — no session dispatches this entry, so wiring the rewrite over the address
 *   would pass vacuously; and nothing here speaks for whether the registers it leaves are dead (arm 4
 *   bounds WHICH ones may move, not that nothing reads them).
 * HOLE: the sweep moves the roamer against slots that all hold the same coordinates, so it cannot tell
 *   which of the six a hit came from — the multiple-hit twin covers the sweep not stopping at the first.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-4fe0.test.js
