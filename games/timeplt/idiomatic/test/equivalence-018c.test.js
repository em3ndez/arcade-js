/**
 * fetchWideTableWord — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x018C.
 *
 * GATE: unit-capture on the real dispatch, but the comparison is RAM **plus a declared
 *   live-out**, because RAM ALONE IS VACUOUS FOR THIS ROUTINE. It writes nothing at all; the
 *   whole effect is the value it leaves in a register pair. `unitEquivalence` therefore reports
 *   `ram: null` for a bare `() => {}` exactly as readily as for the real thing, and a test
 *   asserting only that would be green and worthless. The BLIND arm makes that an assertion.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT, derived from the CALLERS rather than from the instruction sequence. Seven routines
 *   call this one. Every one of them consumes the fetched word: five exchange it into the
 *   address pair and read a text record through it, one stores its two halves into an actor
 *   record, and one jumps to it as a handler address. So DE is live everywhere.
 *   Nothing else is. The table cursor HL is overwritten before it is read at all seven sites —
 *   five exchange it away and then reload both halves from the record, one loads a fresh
 *   constant, one loads the return address it is about to push. The accumulator is reloaded at
 *   every site before any read (from a record, from a work-RAM cell, or from B). No site tests
 *   the flags this routine leaves; the two sites that transfer control without setting flags
 *   first — the shared character loop and the computed handler — each begin with a compare that
 *   sets them afresh. EXCLUDED is {a, f, h, l, sp}, pinned by name so it cannot silently widen,
 *   and `pc` diverges too: the oracle ends by popping a return address into the program counter
 *   and the rewrite, being ordinary JavaScript, does not.
 *
 *   Reading callers is not proof on its own, so MEASUREMENT finishes the job — see LIVE-OUT
 *   (MEASURED) below, which wires the rewrite into a full driven run and shows that everything
 *   dropped reaches nothing the display reads.
 *
 * THE STACK IS NOT MODELLED. The idiomatic layer lets the host language own the call stack, so
 *   this routine does not consume the return address its callers push. Substituted one-for-one
 *   into the still-translated engine it therefore leaks two bytes per dispatch and the engine
 *   dies on a stale return address. That is the known mixed-migration leak, not a defect here,
 *   and it resolves when the callers stop pushing. EXPECTED DIVERGENCE (STACK) pins the
 *   measurement so the claim is checked rather than asserted.
 *
 * THE CYCLE MODEL IS NOT MODELLED EITHER, AND HERE THAT HAS AN EDGE. The oracle spends time
 *   between its two byte reads; the rewrite reads a word with no time between them. Everywhere
 *   the game actually points a table that is invisible, because the bytes are in ROM. Point the
 *   table into the port block and it is not: the raster register moves under the second read.
 *   EXPECTED DIVERGENCE (RASTER) measures that, and it is why the page sweep excludes those
 *   pages rather than pretending they pass.
 *
 * `r.equal` is unused and stays false by design — it folds in the register diff that
 *   memory-equivalence deliberately drops.
 *
 * What it exercises, holes stated:
 *   1. BLIND — the RAM half is proven vacuous, so it cannot be mistaken for the gate.
 *   2. EQUAL at the real dispatch — RAM identical AND the live-out identical.
 *   3. EXCLUDED — exactly {a, f, l, sp} move at the captured entry, plus pc; the fetched word
 *      does not. The cursor's high byte is idle at THIS entry, so a crafted carry entry covers
 *      it separately rather than leaving `h` in EXCLUDED unexercised.
 *   4. EXHAUSTIVE (REAL TABLES) — both tables the game really passes, swept over every index.
 *   5. EXHAUSTIVE (ADDRESS ARITHMETIC) — every low byte of the base against every index, which
 *      is the whole cross-product of the two carries the address sum can produce.
 *   6. PAGES — the base walked across every page, so the arithmetic cannot depend on where the
 *      table sits. The sixteen pages whose fetch lands in the port block are excluded BY COUNT.
 *   7. CORPUS — every base-and-index pair the running game presents over a driven tape.
 *      Its two blind spots are asserted, not assumed: no real dispatch carries out of the
 *      doubling and none carries out of the low byte, so arms 4-6 are load-bearing.
 *   8. EXPECTED DIVERGENCE (STACK) — the leak, measured and recorded.
 *   9. EXPECTED DIVERGENCE (RASTER) — the port-block edge, measured and recorded.
 *  10. LIVE-OUT (MEASURED) — the dropped cursor, accumulator and flags reach nothing.
 *  11. TEETH — six broken twins with exact catch counts on every space. Two of them are
 *      invisible to the entire real corpus, and that blindness is asserted rather than implied.
 *
 * HOLE: the corpus is one tape. It reaches live play, but not every screen the game can draw.
 * HOLE: the memory the tables sit in is whatever the captured entry holds; the sweeps vary the
 * base and the index, never the bytes underneath them.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-018c.test.js
