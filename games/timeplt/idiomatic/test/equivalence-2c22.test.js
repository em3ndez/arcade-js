/**
 * moveObjectByStateByteThenRunAppearance — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x2C22.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. One record byte read, one two-way branch on it, and then a shared appearance step
 * that runs whichever way the branch went. All THREE routines it reaches ARE ALREADY DECOMPILED —
 * decrementObjectStateThenFlyAtSlowestSpeed, driftWithWorldScroll and loc_2c31 — so the rewrite calls them directly and dissolving
 * those transfers belongs to this caller's unit.
 *
 * ★ THE DECLARED RANGE ENDS AT 0x2C30 AND THE CONTINUATION BEGINS AT 0x2C31. The frozen form
 *   pushes that address, jumps to one of two bodies, and borrows their return to arrive at it —
 *   so a rewrite worked from the range rather than from the call graph would inline a routine
 *   that already has a name and a gate of its own. It is not inlined here: CALLS, NOT RESTATES
 *   reads the module's own text for the three imports and for the absence of a marker that
 *   belongs to each callee's body, and runs the same predicate over those callees as a positive
 *   control, so the absence is only evidence once the check is shown able to see it present.
 *
 * ★ THE ORACLE PUSHES AND THE REWRITE DOES NOT, so the bytes just below the entry stack pointer
 *   are dead scratch on one side only. The window is MEASURED, and it is DEEPER on the crafted
 *   low band than at any real dispatch; both figures are pinned separately.
 *
 * ★ THE ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING AND THE GATE SAYS SO. The countdown arm decrements the same record
 *   byte the appearance step then reads, so running the two the other way round paints a
 *   different frame. The order-swapped twin exists for exactly that, and its catch count is
 *   pinned.
 *
 * ★ EVERY REGISTER THAT MOVES HERE IS ALREADY EXCLUDED BY A CALLEE'S OWN GATE. The measured set
 *   is the union of the sets those three files declare, and the EXCLUDED arm asserts that union
 *   rather than an invented list, so this entry cannot quietly widen the exclusion its callees
 *   established.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT, DERIVED FROM THE ORACLE. Its one call site returns immediately after it, so by
 *   reading alone the live-out is MEMORY. Walking further: that caller is reached by a tail from
 *   an era arm, which is reached by a tail from an indexed dispatch, which is reached by a tail
 *   from a record-base setter, and the site THOSE return to is a call that reloads the record
 *   base, the sprite base, the accumulator, the flags and the pair the dispatch reads before any
 *   of them is looked at. I could not close the pair the flag byte lives in by reading — nothing
 *   on that path writes it — so its deadness rests on the whole-machine arm rather than on a
 *   reading, and this file says so rather than claiming the walk finished.
 *
 * GATE: strict unit-capture, two replayed sessions at every dispatch, an exhaustive sweep of the
 *   record byte crossed with the request cell, and a whole-run masked diff.
 *
 *   TEETH: one twin (threshold low by one) is caught by NO real dispatch and no whole run — it only
 *   matters to a record byte the game never presents here, so three crafted entries alone hold it.
 *
 * HOLE: the record bases are the ones attract and the shared tape present; nothing here sweeps
 * the record table, and the sprite base is never varied independently of the record base.
 * HOLE: the low band's retire path writes through a helper this file does not vary; that helper
 * has its own gate and this one only shows both sides take it together.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-2c22.test.js
