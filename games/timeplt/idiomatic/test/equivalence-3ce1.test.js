 * loc_3ce1 — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x3CE1.
 *
 * ★ NO DRIVEN TAPE REACHES THIS ENTRY AT ALL. The shared tape presses only coin 1 and 1 player
 *   start; IT NEVER FIRES AND NEVER STEERS. A second tape that holds the trigger down and walks
 *   the stick round the compass does not reach it either — both dispatch it ZERO times in 2600
 *   frames. Only the UNDRIVEN ATTRACT DEMO reaches it, and not before frame 1378. Every corpus
 *   arm below therefore runs the attract tape, and test 3 asserts the two driven zeroes and that
 *   first frame, so this is a measured fact rather than a note that could rot.
 *
 * ★ AND THE REAL CORPUS IS DEGENERATE IN THE ONE WAY THAT MATTERS: the answer is FALSE at every
 *   single dispatch, and the carry the caller arrives with is already clear. So a candidate that
 *   answers nothing is INDISTINGUISHABLE from the real routine on real data — the whole-machine
 *   replay passes a no-op, and the twin arms assert that verdict rather than leaving it to be
 *   discovered. The teeth are in the crafted sweep, exhaustive because the routine reads ONE cell.
 *
 * RAM IS NOT THE GATE HERE, and test 1 proves it rather than assuming it: the routine writes no
 * memory, so a RAM comparison returns identical for the real routine, for every twin and for a
 * bare no-op. The live-out is the CARRY FLAG, mirrored by the returned boolean, and every unit arm
 * compares both. `r.equal` is never asserted — it folds in the register diff this contract drops.
 *
 * GATE: strict unit-capture, the attract corpus replayed at every dispatch, an exhaustive sweep of
 *   the routine's entire input space at five record bases, a whole-session hostile-register
 *   instrument, and a whole-machine replay. What it exercises, holes stated:
 *
 *   1. BLIND — a no-op passes the RAM diff, so RAM cannot be this gate.
 *   2. EQUAL at the real dispatch — carry and the returned boolean, with the registers allowed to
 *      differ pinned to exactly {a, f, sp}. The stack pointer is in that set because the layer
 *      models no stack: the frozen routine takes the return its caller pushed and the rewrite does
 *      not.
 *   3. NO DRIVEN TAPE REACHES IT — the two zeroes above, asserted.
 *   4. DEGENERATE ENTRY AND DEGENERATE CORPUS — the captured entry answers false, and so does
 *      every other dispatch; one record base and one era occur. Doubling the entry budget captures
 *      the SAME entry, so no frame budget escapes it, only crafting does.
 *   5. CORPUS — every dispatch of the attract session, compared on carry AND the returned boolean.
 *   6. EXHAUSTIVE — the routine reads exactly one cell, so 256 values IS its whole input space and
 *      every value is swept. The set answering true is asserted to be exactly four values.
 *   7. CRAFTED BASES — the same sweep at four further record bases, because real play presents one.
 *   8. HONEST SIGNATURE — passing the record base explicitly agrees with taking it from the
 *      register the frozen routine reads it from.
 *   9. LIVE-OUT IS CARRY ONLY — measured, not argued: a whole attract session with the accumulator
 *      and every non-carry flag forced hostile after each dispatch is bit-identical to the clean
 *      run, and the tooth beside it shows the instrument is wired, because flipping the carry
 *      instead forks the run.
 *  10. WHOLE-MACHINE — the attract session byte-identical with the rewrite wired through a shim
 *      that pays the oracle's T-states and takes its return, since every path in arrives by a tail
 *      transfer. Its BLIND SPOT is declared per twin and asserted, not summarised.
 *  11. The shim's total, checked against the oracle over the whole sweep.
 *  12. TEETH — eleven twins, each declaring the EXACT number of input values it is caught on, by
 *      carry and by the full returned contract separately, plus its whole-machine verdict.
 *
 * HOLE: EVERY dispatch this gate has ever seen sits in ONE era of the attract demo, at ONE record
 * base. The routine's body reads a single cell and no era cell, so its ANSWER cannot depend on the
 * era — but the states it is dispatched IN are era-limited, and nothing here speaks for the later
 * eras or for a dispatch during real play, because none was ever observed.
 * HOLE: the crafted arms vary the value read and the base it is read from; the rest of the machine
 * stays frozen at the one captured entry.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-3ce1.test.js
