/**
 * dispatchSequencePhase2SubStepArm — equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x17FE, under the
 * DISSOLVED-DISPATCH contract.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. Read the inner sequence step and run the arm that index names out of the word table
 * that follows this entry. The index is taken RAW; the doubling that reaches a two-byte entry wraps
 * at eight bits, so an index and that index plus 128 pick the same slot — the low seven bits are what
 * chooses. The rewrite no longer computes the arm's address and enters it through the restart-vector
 * dispatch; it switches on the low seven bits of the index and calls the arm's idiomatic module
 * DIRECTLY. That module PLAIN-RETURNS — it does not pop a return address, and its own sub-calls are
 * ordinary JS calls, not machine calls that push and pop. So the two sides here NO LONGER share an
 * exit stack pointer or an exit program counter, and neither is compared: with the dispatch dissolved,
 * the arm's return is supplied at the seam in production, and the contract that remains is the WORK
 * MEMORY the arm and its sub-calls leave.
 *
 * ★ HOW THE LIVE-OUT WAS DERIVED, and it is from the ORACLE. The oracle's exit successor is the ARM
 *   (this mode's shared tail does nothing at all): whatever the arm writes to memory is this entry's
 *   product. Registers are NOT part of the contract — the arm plain-returns and leaves whatever its
 *   body leaves — so the live-out is the arm's work-memory footprint, and the gate runs the arms
 *   rather than stopping at the address it would have computed.
 *
 * ★ THE ONE PLACE THE TWO SIDES DIVERGE is a dead band of stack scratch, 0xAFE2..0xAFE7, and it is
 *   MASKED. The oracle enters the arm through a chain that pushes and pops nested return addresses
 *   into those bytes; the rewrite calls the arm directly and never writes them. Those bytes lie below
 *   the stack pointer both sides leave, so they are transient stack scratch, dead the moment the arm
 *   returns — a difference confined to them is not a difference in any value the game goes on to use.
 *   The SCRATCH test proves the mask is not blind: divergence really does appear inside the band (so
 *   the instrument can see it), and NOTHING escapes it (so outside the band the two sides are
 *   byte-identical). The TEETH prove the mask is not over-broad: a wrong arm writes real work memory
 *   outside the band and is caught.
 *
 * GATE: strict unit-capture over the shared coin-then-start tape, plus crafted selectors off each
 *   live arm; the memory comparison masks only the dead scratch band above.
 *
 * HOLE: the session presents four of the table's slots (0..3). The rest are crafted, and from an
 * entry state their arm would not really see; where such an arm faults it is asserted only to fault
 * IDENTICALLY on both sides, never to be correct.
 * HOLE: only the first five slots address code this port has transcribed. The rewrite raises the
 * same fault the dispatch would for the slots beyond them, and the sweep records that both sides
 * fault the same way — a statement about the dispatch, not about those words.
 * HOLE: the index is taken RAW, so the crafted sweep is scoped to the table's own slots (0..7) and
 * the same slots reached through the eight-bit wrap (128..135). Indices between those two runs select
 * bytes further down the image that are not part of this table; what the oracle does there is outside
 * this entry's contract and is not asserted.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-17fe.test.js
