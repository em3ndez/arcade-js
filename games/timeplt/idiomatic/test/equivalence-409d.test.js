/**
 * stampObjectStateByte3bThenRequestSound — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x409D.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. One byte stamped into an object's record, then a transfer into the sound-request
 * shim at ROM 0x568E, WHICH IS ALREADY DECOMPILED — so the rewrite calls loc_568e directly and
 * dissolving that transfer belongs to this caller's unit.
 *
 * ★ THE ORACLE MAKES A TEST WHOSE TWO ANSWERS GO TO THE SAME PLACE. Between the stamp and the
 *   transfer it loads the era cell and tests it, and both the conditional and the unconditional
 *   jump that follows name the same target, so nothing downstream can depend on the answer. The
 *   rewrite therefore does not make the test at all, and THE TEST IS A NO-OP asserts the licence
 *   on the ORACLE rather than assuming it: the era cell is swept over all 256 values and every
 *   outcome the frozen side produces is compared against the first.
 *
 * ★ THIS ENTRY IS NOT REACHED BY THE SHARED TAPE. It needs a longer driven one that fires and
 *   steers, and even then it is dispatched ONCE in two thousand frames. The first arm asserts both
 *   facts so "we used a different tape" cannot quietly become "we never reached it", and the
 *   crafted arms — not the corpus — are what hold this file.
 *
 * ★ THE ORACLE PUSHES AND THE REWRITE DOES NOT, so the bytes just below the entry stack pointer
 *   are dead scratch on one side only. The window is MEASURED and pinned, and every arm walks the
 *   whole dump so the exclusion cannot quietly widen.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT, DERIVED FROM THE ORACLE. Two call sites reach this entry. One follows it with a
 *   decrement of the same record byte, which reads memory and writes the flags; the other follows
 *   it with a call whose first two instructions load the high and low halves of a pair from
 *   memory and whose next writes the flags. Neither reads the accumulator, the flags or any pair
 *   this entry could have left, so the live-out is MEMORY: the stamped byte and whatever the
 *   sound request leaves in the queue.
 *
 * GATE: crafted-entry, because one real dispatch is not a corpus. Holes stated:
 *
 *   1. REACHED, and only by the longer tape — both asserted, and the frame pinned.
 *   2. EQUAL at the real dispatch — identical outside the scratch window.
 *   3. NOT VACUOUS — a no-op FAILS the same masked diff, on a real cell.
 *   4. THE TEST IS A NO-OP — the era cell swept over the ORACLE, all 256 values agreeing outside
 *      the dead scratch. The era value DOES reach that scratch, in the flags byte the request
 *      body parks, and the arm counts how often rather than masking the fact away.
 *   5. EXCLUDED — the registers that move over the whole cross, pinned by measurement.
 *  5b. CALLS, NOT RESTATES — the module's text, with the shim's own body as a control.
 *   6. THE STAMP — the byte read back out of the record, over several record bases.
 *   7. THE SOUND — the code appended to the queue, read back rather than asserted about.
 *   8. GATE CROSS — permission, queue length, era and prior record byte crossed.
 *   9. EXHAUSTIVE — all 256 prior values of the record byte.
 *  10. WHOLE-MACHINE — the driven session with the rewrite wired, diffed every frame. With one
 *      dispatch in the run this arm is an equality check, not a discriminator, and the per-twin
 *      verdicts below say which twins it can and cannot see.
 *  11. TEETH — eight twins, each with an exact catch count over the cross. Two are invisible to
 *      the whole run — with one dispatch, in the first era, under permission already set, neither
 *      the era-gated twin nor the ungated one changes anything the run samples — and their
 *      verdicts record that rather than glossing it.
 *
 * HOLE: WHAT the sound is. Nothing on this processor can say; the code is a byte handed to a
 * second one. This gate fixes that the request is made and under what permission.
 * HOLE: the record bases are the real one and two neighbours, not a sweep of the record table.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-409d.test.js
