/**
 * serviceSlotByHeadByte — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x3DEB.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. A three-way split on the head byte of one slot's record, with all three arms
 * already decompiled, so each transfer is dissolved into a direct call in the rewrite.
 *
 * ★ HOW THIS FILE HANDLES THE MISSING RETURN, because it is the whole reason it can compare pc and
 *   SP instead of excusing them. Every exit of the oracle nets exactly one return: two of them are
 *   its own conditional returns, the third is a transfer whose target returns for it. The rewrite
 *   performs none, which is the shape the dispatch seam is built for — so the candidate is run
 *   THROUGH that seam here, exactly as an assembled run would reach it. The seam MEASURES what the
 *   rewrite did to the stack and throws if it is neither shape, so wiring it in is an assertion and
 *   not an accommodation, and it lets SP and pc be compared for EQUALITY on every entry below.
 *   Nothing in this file asserts that the candidate DIFFERS from the oracle anywhere.
 *
 * ★ THE ENTRY THE UNDRIVEN DEMO PRESENTS IS THE INERT ARM, every single time: the head byte is
 *   zero on all of them, so the real corpus alone cannot tell the rewrite from a routine that does
 *   nothing. The crafted arms are what carry this gate, and the VACUOUS arm states that in an
 *   assertion rather than in prose.
 *
 * GATE: crafted-entry over the routine's whole input byte, plus every dispatch of two real
 *   sessions and a whole-machine replay. What it exercises, holes stated:
 *
 *   1. CORPUS SHAPE — how many dispatches each session presents, and that all of them are inert.
 *   2. EQUAL at the real dispatch — RAM outside the dead stack window, SP and pc all identical.
 *   3. VACUOUS AT THE REAL ENTRY — a do-nothing twin PASSES there, asserted, so the crafted cross
 *      is known to be load-bearing rather than assumed to be.
 *   4. NOT VACUOUS CRAFTED — the same comparison catches the do-nothing twin on 255 of 256 heads.
 *   5. SEAM — SP and pc agree on every crafted entry and every real dispatch, not just the first.
 *   6. EXCLUDED — the registers that move are reported and bounded by a CEILING, asserted as a
 *      subset rather than an equality so that a rewrite agreeing MORE closely cannot fail. SP, pc
 *      and both index registers are asserted to be outside it.
 *   7. EXHAUSTIVE — all 256 head bytes, which is the entire space of the one byte read to choose
 *      an arm.
 *   8. ARMS — the cross is shown to reach all four outcomes, including the retire that only
 *      happens once a flown object lands on a line.
 *   9. CORPUS — every dispatch of both sessions replays identically.
 *  10. WHOLE-MACHINE — the demo session with the rewrite wired through the seam.
 *  11. TEETH — seven twins, each with an exact crafted catch count, plus the whole-machine arm's
 *      own verdict on the do-nothing twin, which is BLIND and is recorded as blind rather than
 *      glossed: the demo takes the inert arm every time, so a candidate doing nothing leaves the
 *      same RAM the oracle does through the entire run.
 *
 * HOLE: one captured machine. The head byte and the two coordinate bytes the line test reads are
 * varied; the rest of RAM, and which slot the index registers point at, are whatever the captured
 * frame left.
 * HOLE: the crafted cross reaches the retire-after-flying outcome by moving the coordinates, not by
 * letting an object fly there over many frames, so nothing here speaks for a slot that crosses a
 * line gradually.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-3deb.test.js
