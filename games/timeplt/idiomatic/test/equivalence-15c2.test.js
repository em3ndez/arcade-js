/**
 * dispatchSequencePhase0SubStepArm — equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x15C2, under the
 * DISSOLVED-DISPATCH contract.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. Read the inner sequence step, keep its low three bits, and run the arm that index
 * names out of the word table that follows. The rewrite no longer computes the arm's address and
 * enters it through the restart-vector dispatch; it switches on the index and calls the arm's
 * idiomatic module DIRECTLY. That module PLAIN-RETURNS — it does not pop a return address, and its
 * own sub-calls are ordinary JS calls, not machine calls that push and pop. So the two sides here
 * NO LONGER share an exit stack pointer or an exit program counter, and neither is compared: with
 * the dispatch dissolved, the arm's return is supplied at the seam in production, and the contract
 * that remains is the WORK MEMORY the arm and its sub-calls leave.
 *
 * ★ HOW THE LIVE-OUT WAS DERIVED, and it is from the ORACLE. The oracle's exit successor is the
 *   ARM: whatever the arm writes to memory is this entry's product. Registers are NOT part of the
 *   contract — the arm plain-returns and leaves whatever its body leaves — so the live-out is the
 *   arm's work-memory footprint, and the gate runs the arms rather than stopping at the address it
 *   would have computed.
 *
 * ★ THE ONE PLACE THE TWO SIDES DIVERGE is a dead band of stack scratch, 0xAFDE..0xAFE9, and it is
 *   MASKED. The oracle enters the arm through a chain that pushes and pops nested return addresses
 *   into those bytes; the rewrite calls the arm directly and never writes them. Those bytes are
 *   popped before any boundary snapshot the game reads — they are transient stack scratch, dead the
 *   moment the arm returns — so a difference confined to them is not a difference in any value the
 *   game goes on to use. The SCRATCH band arm proves the mask is not blind: divergence really does
 *   appear inside the band (so the instrument can see it), and NOTHING escapes it (so outside the
 *   band the two sides are byte-identical). The TEETH prove the mask is not over-broad: a wrong arm
 *   writes real work memory outside the band and is caught.
 *
 * GATE: strict unit-capture over the shared coin-then-start tape, plus crafted selectors off each
 *   live arm; the memory comparison masks only the dead scratch band above.
 *
 * HOLE: the session presents only two of the eight selectors. The other six are crafted, and from
 * an entry state their arm would not really see; where such an arm faults it is asserted only to
 * fault IDENTICALLY on both sides, never to be correct.
 * HOLE: only two of the eight table words address code this port has transcribed. The other six
 * read as addresses only because the three bits admit them; the rewrite raises the same fault the
 * dispatch would, and the sweep records that both sides fault the same way — a statement about the
 * dispatch, not about those words.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-15c2.test.js
