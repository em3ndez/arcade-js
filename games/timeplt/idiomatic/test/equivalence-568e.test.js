/**
 * loc_568e — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x568E.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. Two instructions: load one byte of the program image, then transfer to the shared
 * request body, WHICH IS ALREADY DECOMPILED — so the rewrite calls it directly with the byte as
 * an argument, and dissolving that transfer belongs to this caller's unit. The whole content of
 * the entry is therefore WHICH code it asks for and under WHICH permission.
 *
 * ★ THE TAPE HAD TO BE DRIVEN FURTHER. The shared coin-then-start tape never reaches this entry
 *   inside the harness budget, so this file drives its own longer tape that also fires and steers.
 *   The first arm asserts BOTH facts, so "we used a different tape" cannot quietly become "we
 *   never reached it".
 *
 * ★ THE TWIN A GENUINE IMAGE CANNOT DISCRIMINATE. A rewrite that hard-codes the code instead of
 *   reading it is byte-for-byte identical on an unmodified image, so one arm POKES the source byte
 *   and re-runs both sides: the routine must follow the poke and the baked-constant twin must not.
 *   That twin's blindness without the poke is asserted, so its agreement is never read as
 *   reassurance.
 *
 * GATE, holes stated:
 *   1. REACHED, and only by the longer tape — both asserted.
 *   2. EQUAL at the real dispatch, outside a four-byte dead scratch window below the entry stack
 *      pointer where the frozen body parks values the stack-free rewrite does not. Pinned.
 *   3. THE CODE IT REQUESTS, read back out of the queue rather than asserted about the source.
 *   4. IT READS THE IMAGE — the poked arm above.
 *   5. GATE CROSS — the permission cell swept, which is the only coverage of the dropping arm.
 *   6. EXHAUSTIVE over the queue length, 0..255.
 *   7. TEETH — four twins plus the baked-constant one, each on its own exact count.
 *
 * HOLE: WHAT the sound is. Nothing on this processor can say; the code is a byte handed to a
 * second one. This gate fixes which byte and under what permission, and claims nothing more.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-568e.test.js
