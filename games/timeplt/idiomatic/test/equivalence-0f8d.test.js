/**
 * loc_0f8d — the image-checksum tamper trap, against its frozen twin at the same address.
 *
 * ★ THE REWRITE RAISES WHERE THE ORIGINAL UNWINDS. The frozen trap drops four return words off the
 *   stack (unwinding its caller chain), runs the sprite fixup pass on the fourth word's low byte and
 *   returns through a fifth -- STACK UNWIND pins that off the frozen side. The idiomatic layer lays no
 *   return words: every routine is a direct call and the frame interrupt fires as one, so there is no
 *   chain on the stack to unwind and no faithful transcription of the unwind. The rewrite raises
 *   NotImplemented at the landing instead, and the contract is re-expressed around that: across every
 *   crafted entry it raises NotImplemented naming loc_0f8d and writes NOTHING first (LANDING), while the
 *   frozen side really does return and move state (RAW), so the two are compared at the transfer and
 *   the trap's own effects are not compared. Callers are held to the same transfer by their own gates
 *   (the verdict 0x5303 and the parking step 0x07AD stop the oracle on entry here).
 *
 * ★ THE TRAP IS DEAD ON A GENUINE IMAGE, by construction and by measurement. Its only way in is the
 *   verdict at 0x5303, which springs it when the fold handed on is not 0x67, and the fold's only caller
 *   (the credit line, jp 0x43E8 with HL = 0x086B, B = 0x14) sums fixed program bytes: GENUINE FOLD
 *   recomputes that sum from the image as 0x67. UNREACHED runs both tapes with a live control, and a
 *   wrong total handed to the verdict is the positive control that does reach it. MAME agrees: a
 *   PC-gated tap over 600 s driven and 600 s of attract logged A = B = 0x67 at every sampled fetch of
 *   0x5306 (the tap samples the first six per run) and fetched 0x0F8D zero times.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-0f8d.test.js
