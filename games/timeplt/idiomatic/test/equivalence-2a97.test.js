 * dressSpriteForFineHeading — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x2A97.
 *
 * ★ NO TAPE REACHES IT, AND THAT IS ASSERTED, NOT ASSUMED. Three sessions — the shared coin-then-
 *   start tape, an undriven attract run, and a long driven one that fires and steers — dispatch
 *   this address zero times between them. So the entry state is CRAFTED: a machine captured at a
 *   real dispatch of a different per-slot routine, which arrives with both cursors pointing at a
 *   live actor, and then the cells this entry reads are forced. That is a real state with a
 *   surgical nudge, not a fabrication, and the arm below reports both halves.
 *
 * GATE: EXHAUSTIVE over the routine's entire input space, from that crafted base. It reads exactly
 *   two cells — the heading in the object's record and one bit of a free-running counter — so 256
 *   headings by four counter values covers every distinguishable input. Holes stated:
 *
 *   1. NO TAPE REACHES IT — three sessions, all reported.
 *   2. EXHAUSTIVE — 256 headings against four counter values, poked identically on both sides.
 *   3. IT WRITES EXACTLY TWO CELLS, measured over the whole sweep rather than asserted, outside a
 *      two-byte dead scratch window below the entry stack pointer that every arm pins.
 *   4. THE SWEEP DISCRIMINATES: the shape byte is shown to take several distinct values across the
 *      sweep and to change with the counter bit, so a rewrite that always wrote one shape could
 *      not pass by accident.
 *   5. TEETH — eight twins, each caught on its own exact count over the sweep.
 *
 * HOLE: the base machine's cursors come from a DIFFERENT routine's dispatch, so the object record
 * and the sprite entry are a real pair but not necessarily a pair this address is ever handed.
 * What that costs is realism of the base, not coverage of the arithmetic: the two cells the
 * routine reads are swept exhaustively and the two it writes are checked against the base.
 * HOLE: nothing here says what the two written bytes DO once the display reads them.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-2a97.test.js
