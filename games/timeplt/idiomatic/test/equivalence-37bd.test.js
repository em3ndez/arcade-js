/**
 * gateTheFreeSlotSearchAndPickItsRun — two whole captured corpora (coin-then-start and undriven
 * attract) replayed with the REAL spawner running underneath, crafted sweeps of the routine's input
 * space, and teeth. The gate itself pushes nothing; the spawner it tails into does.
 *
 * The dissolved spawner drops its tail return and never writes the stack scratch the frozen side
 * leaves, so a full comparison masks [low, seat) (floor watched off the oracle's pushes, proved
 * above the data) and asserts the two-byte drift. The gate stages a count and two cursors and tails
 * into the spawner; a staging bug shows as a memory divergence once occupancy makes it visible, so
 * the real rewrite is held to the oracle by the masked full run, and the TWINS — which still reach
 * the spawner by dispatch — are compared against a RECORDER so a staging bug is caught whatever the
 * occupancy. The registers the spawner leaves are excluded as a ceiling.
 *
 * The address is a dispatch target (the caller leaves HL on the low life-tick counter, so the REACH
 * arm measures how often each byte value arrives), and the cleared arm is never taken by either tape
 * (ARMS counts all three with the two the tapes take as the control), so it is crafted.
 *
 * HOLE: the sweeps vary the three cells this routine reads and nothing else.
 * HOLE: the corpus arms run the spawner, so a divergence they catch need not be this routine's; the
 * recorder sweeps localise it.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-37bd.test.js
