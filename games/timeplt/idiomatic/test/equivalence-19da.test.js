 * checkTheCopyrightLineColoursOrDerail — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x19DA.
 *
 * GATE: every dispatch of both sessions; an exhaustive crafted sweep of all thirteen cells over all
 *   256 colour values; a two-bad-cells sweep that pins WHICH cell ends the walk; a raise-site probe
 *   that holds the rewrite's fault to the cell the oracle's walk stopped at; both real callers run
 *   end to end with the rewrite seamed in; a whole-session swap; and a bench of broken twins with
 *   measured catch counts.
 *
 * ★ THE DERAIL NOW RAISES IN THE REWRITE, and the contract is re-expressed around that. The frozen
 *   form transfers into a caption record that runs as code: it steps SP by one, pops misaligned
 *   words, and in this port raises NotImplemented at a call into unmapped space (RAW DERAIL shows
 *   it). There is no faithful routine to transcribe there, so the rewrite raises NotImplemented
 *   where the transfer would land. The registers the frozen form hands that landing are therefore
 *   no longer part of the contract — nothing runs to read them — and the four twins that only
 *   mis-handed registers went with that arm. What stays is WHERE the walk stops: the oracle is run
 *   with a probe at the landing and its offending cell read off the pointer it hands over, and the
 *   rewrite's fault must name that same cell (RAISE SITE, FIRST BAD CELL, and every sweep). A twin
 *   that still jumps to the landing, and one that raises a plain error, are both on the bench.
 *
 * ★ THE DERAIL IS DEAD ON A GENUINE IMAGE: every cell of the line holds one of the two colours the
 *   line is painted and flashed in at every real dispatch of both sessions, which CORPUS asserts
 *   with the dispatch count as its positive control.
 *
 * ★ THE CORPUS PRESENTS ONE COLOUR AND ONE PATH. Measured: at every dispatch of both sessions all
 *   thirteen cells read 0x10, so the taped evidence covers the clean walk and NOTHING of the
 *   derail. Every derail arm below is crafted, and CRAFTED-MATTERS records that the corpus alone
 *   passes a twin that never derails at all.
 *
 * ★ THE CLEAN PATH'S REGISTERS ARE DEAD, AND THAT IS MEASURED RATHER THAN ASSUMED. A, F, B and HL
 *   sit in the ceiling: the rewrite still sets them on a clean walk, but the gate does not demand
 *   it. CONTINUATION runs both real callers to
 *   completion with the rewrite seamed in over the registry and finds no difference in memory OR in
 *   any register, which is what licenses those four sitting in the ceiling.
 *
 * What it exercises, holes stated:
 *   1. WINDOW — the oracle's stack footprint, measured, and pinned at zero: nothing is masked.
 *   2. CORPUS — every dispatch of both sessions, whole-dump identical.
 *   3. NOT VACUOUS — a candidate that does nothing fails on a crafted derail.
 *   4. EXCLUDED — no register outside the measured ceiling moves, with a control twin.
 *   5. EXHAUSTIVE — thirteen cells by 256 colours, derail and clean walk alike, plus both flanking
 *      cells by 256 colours, where the walk must never derail (the extent, measured).
 *   6. FIRST BAD CELL — two bad cells at once; the walk must stop at the nearer one.
 *   7. RAISE SITE — the rewrite's fault names the cell the oracle's walk stopped at.
 *   8. RAW DERAIL — the real destination raises NotImplemented too, with no state written but the
 *      one stack word it pushes on its way into unmapped space.
 *   9. CONTINUATION — both real callers run whole with the rewrite seamed in.
 *  10. SESSION — a whole session swapped, differing only inside the measured stack band.
 *  11. CRAFTED-MATTERS — the twin the corpus alone cannot see.
 *  12. TEETH — a bench of broken twins, each with its measured catch counts.
 *
 * HOLE: the derail's own effects are never compared: the rewrite raises at the boundary by design
 * and RAW DERAIL stops where the port raises.
 * HOLE: no tape reaches the derail, so its arms rest entirely on crafted colour values.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-19da.test.js
