 * requestTwoSounds — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x5683.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. Two sound requests, back to back, through the shared body at ROM 0x5617, WHICH IS
 * ALREADY DECOMPILED — so the rewrite calls it directly, twice, with each code as an argument,
 * and dissolving those two transfers belongs to this caller's unit. The whole content of the
 * entry is therefore WHICH TWO codes go out, in WHICH order, and under which permission.
 *
 * ★ THE TWIN A GENUINE IMAGE CANNOT DISCRIMINATE. Neither code is an immediate: each is fetched
 *   from its own byte of the program image. A rewrite that baked both in as constants is
 *   byte-for-byte identical on an unaltered image, so the arm that would "prove" the reads are
 *   live cannot fail. Two arms therefore poke the source bytes and re-run: the routine must
 *   follow each poke and the baked twin must not. The twin's blindness WITHOUT the poke is
 *   asserted, so its agreement on a genuine image is never read as reassurance.
 *
 * GATE: every dispatch of two real tapes, plus crafted permission and queue sweeps.
 *
 *   1. CORPUS — every dispatch of the shared coin -> start tape and of undriven attract, each a
 *      whole-state-dump comparison outside the scratch window.
 *   2. THE DEAD STACK SCRATCH IS THE ONE EXCLUSION, pinned to [SP-8, SP): each pass through the
 *      shared body brackets its work with two pushes and the append pushes a return of its own,
 *      and the second pass runs one level shallower than the first because this entry reaches it
 *      as a tail. An upper bound, and every arm asserts nothing escapes it.
 *   3. REGISTERS AND PC ARE EXCLUDED, DELIBERATELY, and pinned to at most {a, f, sp}.
 *   4. TWO CODES, IN ORDER — read back off the ORACLE from the queue it appends to, so the pair
 *      and its order are measured rather than asserted about the source bytes.
 *   5. IT READS THE IMAGE — each source byte poked in turn; the appended code must follow.
 *   6. GATE CROSS — both permission cells swept against each other, which is the only coverage of
 *      the drop branch; no tape state reaches it.
 *   7. EXHAUSTIVE over the queue length, 0..255, where the wrap of the write index lives.
 *   8. TEETH — six twins over which pair goes out and in which order, plus the baked-constant
 *      one, whose blindness on a genuine image is pinned.
 *
 * HOLE: WHAT the two sounds are. Nothing on this processor can say; each code is a byte handed to
 * a second one. This gate fixes which two bytes, in which order, and under what permission.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-5683.test.js
