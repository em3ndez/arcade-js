/**
 * stepMotherShipWarpFlashFrame — the misaligned entry at ROM 0x459B, dissolved to a fault.
 *
 * 0x459B is entered on exactly two transfers, both anti-tamper derails: 0x176A jumps here when a
 * caption glyph read off the screen is not the genuine one, and 0x43F0 (at 0x4646) jumps here when
 * the tamper-witness pair does not hold the genuine values. Entered here, the prologue pops the
 * caller's return slot as data, steps SP by one, pops again out of step, and every exit returns
 * through a slot at an odd offset from the frame — control is destroyed rather than handed back. The
 * object's genuine warp/flash step is entered past this prologue (0x45B3) and is gated elsewhere.
 * So the rewrite raises NotImplemented at this entry, and this gate no longer byte-replays the body
 * that runs on a broken stack — it asserts the fault and PROVES the fault stands in for no live path:
 *
 *   THROWS    — the entry raises NotImplemented, before writing a byte, on every captured and
 *               crafted state the old gate replayed; the pre-fault form (the frozen body) is the
 *               control that this arm can fail.
 *   LANDING   — why raising is the faithful form: on every one of those states the frozen body ends
 *               with SP an ODD distance from its seat, so its return is read out of step.
 *   UNREACHED — over the coin-start tape and a long undriven run the target is never dispatched,
 *               while its two dispatchers and the drift site are (the positive controls).
 *   GENUINE   — the two guards' inputs, measured over the same runs: at every 0x176A dispatch the
 *               glyph cell holds the genuine glyph; every write to the witness pair after the boot's
 *               plant holds a genuine value, and that plant lands before the first 0x43F0 dispatch.
 *   TAMPER    — each guard is genuinely conditional: the idiomatic 0x176A arm raises THIS fault on a
 *               poked glyph (and the frozen 0x176A reaches this address), and returns on the genuine
 *               one; the idiomatic 0x4646 arm raises THIS fault on a zeroed witness and returns on
 *               each genuine witness pair.
 *
 * HOLE: GENUINE is measured over the runs named, not derived symbolically — the glyph and witness
 * cells are RAM painted and sampled at run time.
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-459b.test.js
