 * foldImageBlockIntoSignatureThenAdvanceSequence — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x17E2.
 *
 * GATE: unit-capture with ONE measured exclusion, a captured real corpus from four sessions, a
 *   sweep that is exhaustive over the routine's whole varying input by decomposition, a
 *   whole-machine replay, and teeth.
 *
 *   THE FROZEN ROUTINE PUSHES AND THE REWRITE DOES NOT. It brackets two calls, both at the same
 *   depth, so the bytes just below the entry stack pointer are dead scratch on one side only. The
 *   window is MEASURED by the WRITE-SET arm rather than read off the instruction stream, every
 *   later arm walks the WHOLE dump and asserts nothing escapes it, and no arm uses the
 *   first-differing-byte helper, which cannot express "differs only inside the window".
 *
 *   ALMOST EVERY INPUT IS A CONSTANT. The block folded, its length, the byte the running total
 *   starts from and the second pointer walked alongside are all fixed in the program image, so
 *   what a crafted entry can vary is the register file it arrives with and the prior contents of
 *   the three cells written. Both are swept exhaustively below. The program image itself cannot be
 *   varied — writes to it are dropped — which is why the twins that must discriminate the block
 *   read a DIFFERENT block rather than a changed one.
 *
 *   WHERE THE LIVE-OUT COMES FROM. It is read off the frozen routine's exit successor, not off the
 *   rewrite. Its only exit is a tail jump to ROM 0x0F1A, which ends in a plain `ret`, so whatever
 *   that leaves goes to whoever reached THIS routine — and nothing calls it: no `call 0x17E2` in
 *   the transcribed image, and no `m.call(0x17e2)` either. The ENTRY REACH arm below shows what it
 *   is reached by instead: every captured dispatch arrives holding this very routine's own address,
 *   which is what a computed dispatch through a register looks like. Traced with a probe on all
 *   three `jp (hl)` sites in the transcribed image, both undriven dispatches came in through ROM
 *   0x0B93's inline table and then ROM 0x0030's, nested. Arms of those tables leave wholly
 *   different register files from one another, so nothing downstream can be reading one. Hence
 *   memory-only.
 *
 *   THE REGISTER CEILING IS A TRIPWIRE, NOT THE CONTRACT. Because the live-out is memory-only, no
 *   register is owned by this gate; the declared set is a CEILING with headroom over what is
 *   measured, so it refuses no rewrite that clobbers fewer registers, and it still catches a
 *   rewrite reaching an index or shadow register this routine has no business touching.
 *
 *   THE REWRITE DROPS ONE STORE THE FROZEN ROUTINE MAKES — a constant into a register that the
 *   fold then overwrites on every step of its run. That is licensed by a property of the FROZEN
 *   routine, not of the rewrite, so the DEAD STORE arm measures it on the frozen side alone: the
 *   frozen routine is run from entries differing only in that register and leaves the same value.
 *
 * What it exercises, holes stated:
 *   1. CONTRACT — the shared unit harness reaches the routine; its first-byte verdict is checked
 *      to be inside the stack rather than treated as the contract.
 *   2. WRITE-SET — the addresses the frozen routine moves, measured, split into cells and scratch.
 *   3. EQUAL at the real dispatch — the whole dump outside the window, and the three cells.
 *   4. NOT VACUOUS — a no-op FAILS the same masked diff, on a real cell.
 *   5. ENTRY REACH — dispatches per session and what every entry arrives holding.
 *   6. CORPUS — every captured dispatch of four sessions.
 *   7. EXCLUDED, as a CEILING — over the whole register sweep, nothing outside the set moves.
 *   8. DEAD STORE — the frozen routine's own constant store is measured dead, on the frozen side.
 *   9. CELL SWEEP — all 256 prior values of EACH of the three written cells. The three writes take
 *      their values from a constant, from the program image, and from that cell's own prior value,
 *      which arm 2 corroborates, so sweeping each independently is exhaustive over the three.
 *  10. REGISTER SWEEP — all 256 entry values of each byte register, and a cross of the pairs.
 *  11. THE REUSED MACHINES ARE SOUND — clone-per-point masked agreement on a sample.
 *  12. WHOLE-MACHINE — an undriven session with the rewrite wired, diffed every frame, differing
 *      only on the frozen side's own call bracket, each differing address asserted to be a stack
 *      address and the set pinned.
 *  13. SEED — the byte the running total starts from is measured, because it is ZERO in this image
 *      and that is what makes one of the twins below uncatchable.
 *  14. TEETH — nine twins with exact catch counts over the sweep, the corpus and the whole run.
 *  15. TWO RECORDED-INVISIBLE TWINS, caught by nothing at all, each for a stated reason: one moves
 *      only a register, which a memory-only contract does not own, and one drops a seed byte this
 *      image holds at zero. Their zeros are ASSERTED, and each assertion is accompanied, in the
 *      same arm, by the same three instruments catching a twin that does move a cell — without
 *      that control three zeros would be indistinguishable from three blind instruments.
 *
 * HOLE: the folded block is read out of the program image, which cannot be varied here, so the
 * arms that hold this file to THAT block are the twins reading a different one — not a sweep.
 * HOLE: the corpus is one or two dispatches per session; the sweeps carry this gate.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-17e2.test.js
