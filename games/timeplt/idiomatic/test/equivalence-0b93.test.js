/**
 * runCommandRingDrainLoop — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x0B93.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. The foreground loop. It consumes the command ring forever: read cursor, occupancy
 * test, take two bytes, free both cells, step and wrap the cursor, and run the handler the low
 * nibble selects out of a sixteen-entry address table fixed in the image. The frozen side reads the
 * table and jumps through it with a return slot parked on the stack; the rewrite switches on the
 * nibble and calls each slot's handler directly, handing it the argument byte.
 *
 * ★ NEITHER SIDE RETURNS, so each is stopped after exactly ONE command, each by its own hand:
 *   - the frozen side's jump through the table lands on a recorder, in one clone's own registry,
 *     that runs the REAL frozen handler and then points the program counter at a no-op address the
 *     loop does not own; the loop treats that as "the arm went somewhere else", hands over to it and
 *     returns — through its own code;
 *   - the rewrite runs the REAL rewritten handler (a direct import the registry cannot see) and loops;
 *     _spineSever.js stops it at its SECOND look at the read cursor, from inside the loop's own frame,
 *     before that look reads anything — i.e. after exactly one pass.
 *   Both sides therefore run the whole consume-and-dispatch path AND the handler, and are compared on
 *   everything that leaves behind. That is a stronger comparison than a stubbed handover: which
 *   handler ran, and with what, shows as the handler's own writes.
 *
 * ★ NO REGISTER IS HANDED TO A HANDLER. The frozen side seats the command, the argument (twice) and
 *   the table words in registers before its jump; the rewrite passes the argument as a parameter and
 *   seats nothing. What the handlers really read is measured, not assumed: EXHAUSTIVE runs every
 *   handler on both sides and compares what they write, and the pair-swapped twin (command and
 *   argument exchanged in the two registers only the frozen side seats, the accumulator left right)
 *   is caught NOWHERE — the recorded proof that no handler reads either register.
 *
 * ★ THE SWITCH IS THE TABLE. The table never changes while the game runs, so each case is the handler
 *   its slot names. SLOTS reads all sixteen words out of the image and checks the cases against them
 *   by behaviour: every slot the registry transcribes gives identical results on both sides, and
 *   every slot it does not is refused by both.
 *
 * ★ THE STACK WINDOW IS EXCLUDED — the manifest's measured window, not a number typed here. The
 *   frozen side parks return slots there that the rewrite never pushes, and its handlers push their
 *   own scratch.
 *
 * GATE: crafted-entry, one command per run, over the ring's whole command space. Holes stated:
 *
 *   1. THE ENTRY — captured at the one real dispatch, which happens once per session at boot.
 *   2. ONE COMMAND — both sides stop after exactly one command.
 *   3. EQUAL — identical outside the stack window on the real cursor.
 *   4. NOT VACUOUS — a no-op FAILS the same masked diff on a real cell.
 *   5. SLOTS — all sixteen table words against the switch.
 *   6. EXHAUSTIVE — all 128 occupied command bytes against several cursors and arguments.
 *   7. COMMAND_RING WRAP — cursors that take the step past the end of the ring.
 *   8. IDLE — an empty ring: the rewrite yields having written nothing.
 *   9. TEETH — nine twins, each with an exact catch count over the crafted space.
 *
 * HOLE: the frozen idle spin cannot be run to a stop, so the IDLE arm is one-sided.
 * HOLE: there is no whole-run arm and no session corpus beyond the single boot dispatch; the handlers
 *   run from that one boot state, so a handler's play-state paths are its own gate's business.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-0b93.test.js
