/**
 * loc_599d — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x599D.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. One instruction and a fall-through: read the heading byte out of the object record
 * the caller is pointing at, then continue into the DOUBLED velocity lookup at 0x59A0, which IS
 * ALREADY DECOMPILED — so the rewrite calls doubledVelocityForHeading directly and dissolving that
 * transfer belongs to this caller's unit. What separates this entry from the sibling shims at
 * 0x59C5/0x59CB/0x59D1 is two things at once: the heading comes off a RECORD rather than in as a
 * value, and the table pointer is FORWARDED rather than replaced, so the pace is the caller's.
 *
 * ★ RAM ALONE CANNOT GATE THIS ROUTINE. The lookup writes no memory, so a RAM diff reports
 *   identical for the correct arm, for every twin, and for a bare no-op. The BLIND arm asserts
 *   exactly that, and it is the written justification for gating on RAM *plus* the declared
 *   live-out {b, c, d, e} everywhere else.
 *
 * ★ THE LIVE-OUT IS DERIVED FROM THE ORACLE, AND FROM ITS EXIT SUCCESSORS, NOT FROM THE MODULE.
 *   The oracle ends by taking the return of the routine it falls into, so its successor is the
 *   caller's own slot. There are two such successors in the image and they agree: each banks four
 *   registers into four consecutive bytes of the record the entry was handed, and neither reads
 *   anything else the entry leaves — one reloads the pair it just stored from the stack on the very
 *   next instruction, the other reloads the accumulator out of memory before using it. The SEAT arm
 *   below shows the oracle landing on the first of those two successors, so the derivation is
 *   watched and not only read. Empirically the LIVE-OUT arm forces a, f and hl hostile AFTER every
 *   real dispatch of a whole session and the run stays bit-identical, while forcing either half of
 *   the pair alone forks it — so the pair is live, the rest is not, and both directions are proved.
 *
 * ★ THE CORPUS IS THIN AND UNIFORM IN THE TWO WAYS THAT MATTER, AND BOTH ARE MEASURED HERE RATHER
 *   THAN ASSUMED. Every real dispatch arrives holding the SAME table, and at every real dispatch
 *   the accumulator ALREADY HOLDS the byte the record holds, because the one caller that reaches
 *   this entry writes the heading into the record from the accumulator immediately before calling.
 *   Two twins are therefore invisible to real play — one that pins the table it always sees, one
 *   that reads the accumulator instead of the record — and they are recorded as caught by zero real
 *   dispatches rather than quietly counted as coverage. The crafted cross is what holds them.
 *
 * ★ EVERY ZERO IN THIS FILE IS PAIRED WITH A POSITIVE CONTROL IN THE SAME ARM. Three tapes reach
 *   this entry zero times; the SAME three tapes with one cell held in the once-per-frame service
 *   reach it. The dead registers leave no trace; the live pair forks the run. The pinned-table twin
 *   is caught by no real dispatch; it is caught 1792 times in the cross.
 *
 * GATE: strict unit-capture, six replayed real sessions at every dispatch, an exhaustive cross of
 *   every table this entry can be handed against the whole heading space, and a whole-machine
 *   replay. What it exercises, holes stated:
 *
 *   1. CONTRACT — unitEquivalence at the first real dispatch: RAM identical. `equal` is not
 *      asserted; it folds in the register diff this contract deliberately drops.
 *   2. BLIND — that same call passes a no-op, which is why the pair is gated too.
 *   3. SEAT — the rewrite leaves the stack pointer exactly where it found it, over the whole cross.
 *      That is the shape the dispatch seam measures, asserted here as a property of the rewrite.
 *   4. TAPE REACH — measured, with the A/B that makes each zero mean something.
 *   5. UNIFORM CORPUS — one record base, one table, a handful of headings.
 *   6. THE ACCUMULATOR SHADOWS THE RECORD — measured at every real dispatch.
 *   7. CORPUS — every dispatch of every session, not a deduplicated sample.
 *   8. EXCLUDED — a CEILING over the whole cross: no register outside the scratch set moves.
 *   9. EXHAUSTIVE CROSS — eight pointers by all 256 headings, RAM and the pair.
 *  10. LIVE-OUT — the hostile-register instrument, with its controls in both directions.
 *  11. POINTER DISCRIMINATION — read out of memory: no two of the eight pointers agree on BOTH
 *      halves of the pair at any heading, which is why a pinned-pointer twin cannot hide.
 *  12. WHOLE-MACHINE — a held session with the rewrite wired, diffed every frame.
 *  13. TEETH — fifteen twins, each with its exact cross catch count, its exact per-session count,
 *      and its whole-machine verdict; the two that no real dispatch catches say so.
 *
 * The whole-machine replay needs a shim: the host engine is cycle-driven and the way in is a call
 * that ends in the lookup's own return, so a candidate charging no T-states and not taking that
 * return would move the vblank interrupt and leak two stack bytes per dispatch. The total is
 * measured off a clone per dispatch rather than predicted, which makes it exact by construction.
 *
 * HOLE: ONE record base across the whole corpus, and every crafted arm varies the heading inside
 * that record or the pointer beside it, never the record it is read from. Nothing here speaks for
 * a second slot.
 * HOLE: the second real way in — the era-indexed dispatch that would hand this entry the 0x5C00
 * table — is reached by NO session in this file. That table appears here only as a crafted pointer,
 * so nothing here shows the game itself taking that path.
 * HOLE: the pair is compared as four register bytes. Which of the two is the screen's across and
 * which its down is not settled anywhere in this file.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-599d.test.js
