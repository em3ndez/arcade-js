/**
 * countTheKillAndGrantTheSharedToken — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x2BBA.
 *
 * GATE: every dispatch of both sessions; a crafted cross-product over all four guards; exhaustive
 *   single-cell sweeps of the kill count, the shared countdown and the slot ordinal; a whole
 *   session swapped live; and a bench of broken twins with measured catch counts.
 *
 * ★ THREE OF THE FOUR EXITS ARE REACHED BY A REAL DISPATCH AND ONE IS NOT. Measured over the
 *   two sessions: of the dispatches captured, some return at the first guard, some spend a tick
 *   of the shared countdown and return, and exactly one goes all the way and writes the claim. The
 *   exit that is NEVER reached is the second guard — at every dispatch where the first guard passed
 *   the arming cell was non-zero, so the arming guard's REFUSAL is crafted-only here. ARMS measures
 *   all four counts rather than asserting the coverage, and the arming twin's catch count is what
 *   shows the crafted arm is doing work the corpus cannot.
 *
 * ★ THE SOUND REQUEST IS A DIRECT CALL AND ITS WINDOW IS MEASURED. The oracle reaches the request
 *   through the registry, brackets it with a push, and takes its own return; the rewrite calls the
 *   idiomatic sibling and leaves the return to the seam. The bytes that differ are exactly the dead
 *   stack the two conventions leave behind, and WINDOW pins the width of that at ten with BOUNDARY
 *   proving a scribble one byte below it is still caught.
 *
 * ★ THE COUNTDOWN IS SPENT BY EVERY CLAIMANT, NOT ONLY THE WINNER. It is stepped as soon as the
 *   first two guards pass and the test for zero happens after the step, so an entry that loses
 *   still leaves the cell one lower. The COUNTDOWN sweep walks all 256 values so the wrap at zero
 *   is covered, and the claims-early twin exists to prove the ordering is what is being measured.
 *
 * What it exercises, holes stated:
 *   1. WINDOW — the oracle's stack footprint, measured over corpus and sweep, pinned at 10.
 *   2. BOUNDARY — a scribble inside the window is masked, one byte below it is caught.
 *   3. CORPUS — every dispatch of both sessions, identical outside the window.
 *   4. ARMS — which of the four exits the corpus actually reaches, counted.
 *   5. NOT VACUOUS — a candidate that does nothing fails the same comparison, on a real cell.
 *   6. EXCLUDED — no register outside the measured ceiling moves, with a control twin.
 *   7. GUARDS — the crafted cross-product over all four guards, on two record slots.
 *   8. SLOTS — every record pointer the corpus presents, at each of the four exits.
 *   9. KILLS — all 256 values of the kill count, and the floor at zero.
 *  10. COUNTDOWN — all 256 values of the shared countdown, wrap included.
 *  11. ORDINAL — all 256 slot ordinals, so the mark is an addition and not an or.
 *  12. SESSION — a whole session swapped, differing only inside the measured stack band.
 *  13. TEETH — a bench of broken twins, each with its measured catch counts.
 *
 * HOLE: what the claim cell BUYS is entirely outside this gate. Nothing here reads it back, so a
 * rewrite could write the right byte to the right cell at the wrong moment in the round and every
 * arm would stay green.
 * HOLE: the record pointer only ever takes the values the corpus presents. A slot outside that set
 * is never exercised, and neither is a pointer that would wrap the address space.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-2bba.test.js
