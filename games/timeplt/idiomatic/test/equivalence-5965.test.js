/**
 * loc_5965 — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x5965.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. Two instructions: load a fixed table pointer, then tail-jump to the velocity lookup
 * at 0x596E, which IS ALREADY DECOMPILED — so the rewrite calls velocityForHeading directly with
 * the table as an argument, and dissolving that transfer belongs to this caller's unit. The whole
 * content of the routine is therefore the CHOICE OF TABLE plus the fact that the pointer a caller
 * was already holding is thrown away.
 *
 * ★ NO TAPE REACHES THIS ENTRY AT ALL, AND THE TAPE REACH ARM ASSERTS IT. Measured: the shared
 *   coin-then-start tape, undriven attract, and both of the turning tapes below dispatch it ZERO
 *   times in 1500 frames. The routine that picks between the shims reads the era index, and no
 *   tape gets the player out of the first era inside the budget. So every session here is DRIVEN
 *   PLAY WITH THE ERA INDEX POKED to a value that selects this shim, held only for the length of
 *   the routine that reads it and restored on the way out. The game then dispatches this entry
 *   itself. That is the A/B with a control: ONE cell decides whether the same tape reaches this
 *   routine 537 times or not at all.
 *
 * ★ RAM ALONE CANNOT GATE THIS ROUTINE. The lookup writes no memory, so a RAM diff reports
 *   identical for the correct arm, for every twin, and for a bare no-op. The BLIND arm asserts
 *   exactly that, and it is the written justification for gating everywhere else on RAM *plus* the
 *   declared live-out {b, c, d, e}.
 *
 * ★ THE TABLE IS THE ONLY THING THIS ENTRY DECIDES, AND NO TAPE CAN VARY IT. Six velocity tables
 *   sit in the ROM whose peak magnitudes climb in even steps — 0x59D7, 0x5C00, 0x5E00, 0x2530,
 *   0x2E3E, 0x08FA — and a shim like this one is a rung on that ladder. A gate that cannot tell
 *   0x2E3E from its NEIGHBOURS is measuring nothing about this file, so the twins named rung-below,
 *   rung-above, bottom-rung and middle-rung hand the same lookup another rung of that ladder — the
 *   first two being the rungs immediately either side — three more hand it a pointer that is no
 *   table at all, and the RUNG LADDER arm re-derives from the table bytes themselves why none of
 *   them can hide.
 *
 * GATE: strict unit-capture, two driven sessions replayed at every dispatch, an exhaustive sweep
 *   of the whole heading space, and a whole-machine replay of driven play. What it exercises,
 *   holes stated:
 *
 *   1. CONTRACT — unitEquivalence at the first real dispatch: RAM identical. `equal` is not
 *      asserted; it folds in the register diff this contract deliberately drops.
 *   2. BLIND — the same call passes a no-op. If it ever fails, the routine writes memory after all
 *      and every arm below that leans on the live-out has to be re-derived.
 *   3. TAPE REACH — the zero-versus-537 A/B above, run rather than recounted.
 *   4. DEAD FIRST DISPATCH — unitEquivalence clones the FIRST entry and no frame budget changes
 *      which one; the test doubles the budget and asserts the same entry comes back.
 *   5. DEGENERATE ENTRY — that entry sits on a heading whose second component is zero, and one of
 *      the twelve twins is INVISIBLE there. The test says which.
 *   6. UNIFORM CORPUS — the corpus varies the heading and nothing else. It presents ONE record base
 *      and ONE incoming pointer, and 119 of the 256 headings are reached by neither tape. The
 *      second tape is not a duplicate of the first: it adds 15 headings the first never produces.
 *   7. CORPUS — both sessions replayed at EVERY dispatch on RAM plus the live-out.
 *   8. EXCLUDED — over the whole sweep the registers that move are exactly {a, f, h, l, sp} and the
 *      live-out never moves.
 *   9. EXHAUSTIVE — all 256 headings crafted off the real entry, which is what covers the band no
 *      tape drives.
 *  10. THE INCOMING POINTER IS IGNORED — a whole session with it forced to a neighbouring rung
 *      before every dispatch is bit-identical to the clean run.
 *  11. LIVE-OUT IS FALSIFIABLE, NOT ARGUED — the dropped registers forced hostile after every
 *      dispatch of a whole session leave no trace, while either half of the declared pair forced
 *      hostile the same way FORKS the run. That second half is the tooth on the instrument.
 *  12. RUNG LADDER — the six tables' peak magnitudes, and the reason a neighbouring rung is caught
 *      everywhere: a single sample DOES match a neighbour at nine near-zero headings, but the
 *      lookup returns a perpendicular PAIR and no heading has both of them matching.
 *  13. WHOLE-MACHINE — driven play with the rewrite wired, diffed every frame against a baseline
 *      poked the same way, and every twin caught there too.
 *  14. TEETH — twelve twins, each declaring the EXACT headings it survives, the exact number of
 *      real dispatches it is caught on in each session, whether the first dispatch can see it, and
 *      a fork of the whole machine.
 *
 * The replay needs a shim. The host engine is cycle-driven and every caller arrives by a transfer
 * that ends in the lookup's own return, so a candidate charging no T-states and not taking that
 * return would move the vblank interrupt and leak two stack bytes per dispatch. The shim pays both,
 * identically for the real arm and for every twin, and its branch-dependent total is checked
 * against the oracle over all 256 headings rather than assumed.
 *
 * NO STACK-SCRATCH WINDOW IS DRAWN, deliberately. The routine writes no RAM, so there is nothing to
 * exclude and the whole-machine diff covers every byte, the stack included.
 *
 * HOLE: ONE object slot. Every dispatch in both sessions arrives on the same record base, so the
 * crafted arms vary the heading read out of that record, never the record it is read from.
 *
 * HOLE: EVERY dispatch in this file is reached through the poke. Nothing here observes the entry
 * being selected by an era the player actually played into, only by an era written under the
 * selector's feet — the poke is the game's own selection input, but it is not natural play.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-5965.test.js
