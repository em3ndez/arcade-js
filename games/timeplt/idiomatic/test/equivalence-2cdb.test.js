/**
 * blankOneLineThenGuardBlockOrDerailSequence — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x2CDB.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. One turn of the line wipe at ROM 0x01C2, and, on the turn that clears the last line
 * owed, a 1024-byte exclusive-or fold of the program image whose result picks between the two
 * sequence steppers at ROM 0x0F11 and ROM 0x0F1A. Every callee is ALREADY DECOMPILED, so the
 * rewrite calls them directly and dissolving those transfers belongs to this caller's unit.
 *
 * ★ THE ORACLE PUSHES AND RETURNS, AND THE REWRITE DOES NEITHER. The wipe is reached by `call`, so
 *   the oracle brackets it with a pushed return address below the entry seat, and every exit takes
 *   a return the rewrite does not. That leaves DEAD STACK SCRATCH below the seat and moves several
 *   registers, the stack pointer and pc. The window is MEASURED — the WINDOW arm instruments the
 *   oracle's own `push16` over this file's whole sweep — never assumed and never copied from
 *   another gate. Every other arm walks the whole dump and masks ONLY that window.
 *
 * WHY THE LIVE-OUT IS MEMORY ONLY, derived from the ORACLE's exit successors and not from the
 *   module: every exit — the early return, and both tail jumps — returns to 0x181D, which
 *   is a bare `ret`, so no register this entry leaves is read before it is overwritten. Confirmed
 *   by running the tape: the oracle's pc after each captured dispatch is 0x181D.
 *
 * GATE: strict unit-capture replayed over every dispatch the tape produces, plus CRAFTED entries,
 *   because the tape only ever reaches this entry with lines still owed — the fold arm is
 *   unreachable without one. Nudges make it: the lines-owed cell forced to its last line, and,
 *   for the failing arm, ONE BYTE OF THE PROGRAM IMAGE FLIPPED, applied to the shared image so
 *   both sides read the same bytes and restored afterwards.
 *
 *   1. EQUAL      — identical across the whole state dump outside the measured window, over every
 *                   dispatch the tape produces.
 *   2. WINDOW     — the oracle's own deepest push, measured over the whole sweep and PINNED.
 *   3. BOUNDARY   — the exclusion is exactly as wide as it declares: one byte BELOW the window is
 *                   caught, one AT the entry seat is caught, one INSIDE is masked.
 *   4. ARMS       — every exit is really visited by the sweep, told apart by which sequence
 *                   cell the ORACLE moved, so no arm below is being scored on an unreached path.
 *   5. THE FOLD'S EXTENT — measured on the ORACLE, not read off the module: flipping the first
 *                   byte of the block flips the arm it takes, so does flipping the last, and
 *                   flipping the byte just before or just after the block does NOT. Two positives
 *                   and two negatives, which is what makes the extent a measurement.
 *   6. EXCLUDED   — no register outside the declared CEILING moves, with a two-sided control: a
 *                   planted move OUTSIDE the ceiling is reported and one INSIDE is not.
 *   7. CALLS, NOT RESTATES — the module's text: it must name each callee's file and call it rather
 *                   than carry that callee's body, with each callee's own body as a control.
 *   8. TEETH      — broken twins with measured catch counts over the sweep.
 *
 * HOLE: the wipe and the two steppers are gated by their own files. What this file gates is the
 * early exit, the extent and result of the fold, and which stepper each result picks.
 * HOLE: nothing here says what the folded block IS, only where it starts, how long it is, and what
 * total the untampered image gives.
 * HOLE: this gate pins the candidate's pc but leaves sp inside the excluded set, so a rewrite that
 * leaked stack without writing memory would pass here. assembled-swap.test.js owns that.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-2cdb.test.js
