/**
 * destroySlotsAndPlayerOnContact — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x5152.
 *
 * GATE: unit-capture judged by a MASKED RAM diff, a replayed corpus of every dispatch from two
 *   sessions, a crafted sweep that drives the sweep into and out of both windows, and teeth.
 *
 *   THE ONE EXCLUSION is the dead stack scratch: on a hit the frozen routine calls the scoring
 *   post, which pushes further, so up to eight bytes below the entry stack pointer can hold
 *   return slots the rewrite never writes. The window is exactly [SP-8, SP) and every arm PINS
 *   it — each walks the whole dump and asserts no divergence escapes it.
 *
 * What it exercises, holes stated:
 *   1. EQUAL at the real dispatch — identical outside that eight-byte window.
 *   2. NOT VACUOUS — an empty candidate FAILS, at a crafted entry that really registers a hit,
 *      because the real dispatch need not have one.
 *   3. CORPUS — every dispatch of a driven and an undriven session, counts asserted, with the
 *      number of dispatches that actually HIT reported, so a corpus of pure misses is visible
 *      rather than read as coverage.
 *   4. EXCLUDED — the register divergence pinned to a measured set.
 *   5. CRAFTED — both of the player's coordinates swept over their whole 0..255 against a slot
 *      that is in range on the other axis, which walks the sweep in and out of each window in
 *      turn; plus the caller's bias and width varied, both states of the player's own mark, and
 *      a run length of zero, which the routine treats as a full two hundred and fifty-six; and
 *      a family with SEVERAL slots seated on the player at once, which is the only one where a
 *      sweep that stops at its first hit can be told from one that carries on.
 *   6. TEETH — eight twins, each caught on an exact count of crafted entries. Several score in
 *      single figures, and those numbers are the family's shape rather than a weakness: a twin
 *      that only differs once the player has ALREADY been taken can differ on the handful of
 *      points that reach that state, and no more.
 *
 * HOLE: the crafted family leaves the record and entry cursors where the captured dispatch had
 * them, so the two strides are exercised only through the slots that dispatch presents. The
 * wrong-stride twins are caught by that, but a stride error that lands on another LIVE slot
 * would not be, and nothing here rules that out.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-5152.test.js
