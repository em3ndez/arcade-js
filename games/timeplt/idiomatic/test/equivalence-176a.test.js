 * paintReadoutsThenSampleWitnessOrDerail — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x176a.
 *
 * GATE: strict unit-capture over every dispatch of an undriven attract session, one MEASURED stack
 *   window, a crafted wrong-glyph derail, a crafted tamper-sample readback, and teeth.
 *
 * ★ WHERE THE LIVE-OUT COMES FROM. The routine is not reached by any `call` in the image; it is a
 *   table-dispatched sequence arm whose two transfers both leave through the return the dispatcher
 *   parked — the wrong-glyph derail into stepMotherShipWarpFlashFrame (0x459b) and the tail step
 *   through advanceSequenceSubStep (0x0f1a). Each successor reloads every register it uses before
 *   reading one, so NO register is live out and the live-out is memory only. The register ceiling
 *   below is wide for that reason, not because the rewrite is untidy.
 *
 * ★ THE ORACLE PUSHES AND THE REWRITE DOES NOT. The oracle reaches its callees (checkColours,
 *   postCommand, paint, the tail step, and — on the derail — the mother-ship handler) through the
 *   registry, seating return words below the entry seat that the direct-called rewrite never seats.
 *   The window is MEASURED — the WINDOW arm instruments the oracle's own `push16` over this file's
 *   whole sweep — never assumed and never copied from another gate.
 *
 * ★ BOTH DERAILS ARE COMPARED AT THE TRANSFER. The wrong-glyph derail enters the warp/flash step's
 *   misaligned prologue (0x459b) and the colour guard's enters a caption record run as code (0x49fa);
 *   neither has a routine form, so the rewrite raises NotImplemented where the transfer would begin.
 *   The oracle is stopped on entry to the landing (test/_tamperDerail.js), and the two sides must
 *   reach the SAME landing after the SAME work outside the window. On the genuine image neither is
 *   taken: this arm runs only after the copyright screen is built and its line re-flashed every frame
 *   in its two colours, and the "K" at 0xa67c is that line's third glyph in both records.
 *
 * What it exercises, holes stated:
 *   1. CORPUS   — every dispatch of an undriven attract session, replayed from its own captured
 *                 machine, identical outside the measured window.
 *   2. WINDOW   — the oracle's own deepest push, measured over the whole sweep and PINNED.
 *   3. BOUNDARY — a planted divergence one byte BELOW the window is caught, one AT the seat is
 *                 caught, one INSIDE is masked. The third shows the first two are not the
 *                 instrument catching everything.
 *   4. DERAIL   — the glyph cell is forced OFF its expected value on a real captured machine; both
 *                 sides reach the warp/flash landing and agree outside the window up to it.
 *   5. SAMPLE   — on the clean path the sampled glyph/colour pair is marked and read back out of
 *                 the tamper witness cells by value, and the sequence index is shown to step.
 *   6. TEETH    — broken twins with their exact catch counts.
 *
 * HOLE: the five callees are gated by their own files. What this file gates is that they are
 * reached, in order, on the right branch — and which cells the sampling reads and writes.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-176a.test.js
