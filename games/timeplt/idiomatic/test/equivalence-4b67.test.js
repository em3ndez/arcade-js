/**
 * seedRandomRegister — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x4B67.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. A block copy out of program space into the random register's seventeen bytes, then a
 * guard: three bytes taken from two fixed words of program space, added to a constant, and a
 * transfer to an address outside the image unless the total comes round to zero. THE TRANSFER IS
 * THE THROW. It is a guard branch inside a real routine, not a stub standing in for missing work —
 * the routine emulates its copy and its arithmetic, and the SEED and GUARD arms below both run.
 *
 * ★ HOW THE LIVE-OUT WAS DERIVED, AND IT IS FROM THE ORACLE. The oracle's only ordinary exit is its
 *   own return. Of the two return sites this port has transcribed, one stores the ACCUMULATOR to a
 *   latch as its very next instruction and the other loads a fresh address pair before reading
 *   anything; so the accumulator is live and the rest of the register dance is not. The rewrite
 *   therefore leaves the accumulator holding the guard total and drops the rest, and the EXCLUDED
 *   arm asserts the accumulator HELD rather than merely permitted to move.
 *
 * ★ NO STACK IS MASKED, AND THAT IS MEASURED. The oracle pushes nothing at all on this path, so
 *   every comparison here is the WHOLE dump, scratch included. The NO SCRATCH arm instruments the
 *   oracle's own `push16` over the whole sweep and requires zero, with a control that the same
 *   instrument reports a nonzero when a push really happens.
 *
 * ★ THE GUARD BRANCH IS EXERCISED, NOT ARGUED ABOUT. Its operands live in program space, which the
 *   address space refuses to write, so no poke can reach them. The GUARD arm instead builds a
 *   machine on a TAMPERED COPY of the image with the state of a real captured dispatch carried
 *   over, and requires BOTH sides to fault there and NEITHER to fault on the shipped image. That
 *   is also the positive control for the absence: without it, "the guard never fires" would be
 *   indistinguishable from a gate that cannot make it fire.
 *
 * ★ SP AND pc BELONG TO THE DISPATCH SEAM. The oracle nets one return; the rewrite performs none.
 *   The candidate runs THROUGH `withOmittedRet`, and SP and pc are then compared for EQUALITY.
 *
 * GATE: strict unit-capture over every dispatch of two real sessions, a crafted sweep over the
 *   destination's prior contents, a tampered-image arm, and a whole-machine replay.
 *
 *   1. REACH — dispatch counts per session, measured and pinned.
 *   2. EQUAL — the whole dump identical at the first dispatch of each session, SP and pc included.
 *   3. NOT VACUOUS — a candidate that does nothing FAILS the same comparison.
 *   4. NO SCRATCH — the oracle's push depth over the whole sweep, with a control.
 *   5. CORPUS — every dispatch of both sessions replays identically.
 *   6. CRAFTED — the seventeen bytes and both neighbours forced to eight prior patterns, which is
 *      what makes "wrote the right bytes" separable from "found them already right".
 *   7. THE SEED IS FAITHFUL — the destination is compared against the source range read back out
 *      of program space at run time, so the expected bytes are never written down here, and both
 *      neighbours are required untouched.
 *   8. GUARD — the tampered image above.
 *   9. VERDICT — the accumulator both sides leave, and that it is the total the guard tested.
 *  10. EXCLUDED — the registers that move, bounded by a CEILING asserted as a subset, with the
 *      accumulator asserted HELD and a positive control.
 *  11. WHOLE-MACHINE — a wired session of each tape through a shim that also restores the oracle's
 *      T-state cost, differing only in dead stack bytes; and the same instrument catching a
 *      do-nothing twin.
 *  12. TEETH — eight twins on exact counts, including one the sound image is BLIND to and only the
 *      tampered image catches.
 *
 * WHY THE WHOLE-MACHINE SHIM RESTORES T-STATES. No idiomatic module spends any, and the engine this
 * arm drives is cycle-driven, so a rewrite moves the frame phase. Measured here: without the shim
 * this arm reports a dozen character cells differing, all of them phase and none of them memory.
 *
 * HOLE: the SOURCE cannot be varied. It lives in program space, which the address space refuses to
 * write, so every arm varies the destination and reads the source as it is. The GUARD arm is the
 * one exception and it reaches program space by REBUILDING the machine, not by writing to it.
 * HOLE: the corpus is three dispatches across two sessions, all in boot or attract restart, so the
 * crafted priors are doing all the discriminating.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-4b67.test.js
