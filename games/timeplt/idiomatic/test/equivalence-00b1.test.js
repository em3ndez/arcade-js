/**
 * tileCharPlaneWithBoxLattice — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x00B1.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. Two counted loops around a stamp: fourteen bands of sixteen boxes, the cursor stepped
 * two cells along inside a band and a whole line skipped between them. The stamp at ROM 0x00C7 IS
 * ALREADY DECOMPILED, so the rewrite calls stampGridBox directly and dissolving those 224 calls
 * belongs to this caller's unit. Nothing is read to decide where a box goes, so the whole content
 * of the routine is WHICH CELLS, and the LATTICE arm compares that set against the oracle's own.
 *
 * ★ HOW THE LIVE-OUT WAS DERIVED, AND IT IS FROM THE ORACLE. The oracle's only exit is its own
 *   return, and the instructions at the one return site this port has transcribed load a counter, a
 *   fresh address pair, and clear the accumulator before reading any of them — so nothing this
 *   routine leaves in a register is consumed and the live-out is memory only. What the rewrite
 *   happens to agree on anyway is asserted HELD rather than merely permitted, because agreeing more
 *   closely should never be something a gate has to be edited to accept.
 *
 * ★ THE MASKED WINDOW IS THE ORACLE'S OWN, AND IT IS MEASURED. Each dissolved call laid down a
 *   return address and the stamp saved the cursor under it; the rewrite writes neither. The SCRATCH
 *   arm instruments the oracle's own `push16` over this file's whole sweep and PINS the depth it
 *   reaches, so a change in the oracle's stack traffic turns this gate red instead of being
 *   absorbed by a wider mask.
 *
 * ★ THE CRAFTED ENTRIES POISON BOTH PLANES. On a real machine the lattice is stamped onto cells
 *   that mostly already hold the blanking glyph, so an unpoisoned comparison would be weak in
 *   exactly the place the routine works. Filling both planes with a marker first makes every cell
 *   the routine writes visible, and is what gives the LATTICE arm and the teeth their power.
 *
 * ★ SP AND pc BELONG TO THE DISPATCH SEAM. The oracle nets one return; the rewrite performs none.
 *   The candidate runs THROUGH `withOmittedRet`, and SP and pc are then compared for EQUALITY.
 *
 * GATE: strict unit-capture on the one dispatch each session produces, a crafted sweep over the
 *   planes' prior contents, and a convergent whole-machine replay.
 *
 *   1. REACH — dispatch counts per session, measured and pinned.
 *   2. EQUAL — masked RAM, SP and pc identical at the real dispatch of each session.
 *   3. NOT VACUOUS — a candidate that does nothing FAILS the same comparison.
 *   4. SCRATCH — the oracle's own deepest push, pinned; every raw difference strictly below the
 *      entry pointer and no deeper; and at least one seen, so the mask is not decoration.
 *   5. CRAFTED — eight prior fills of both planes, all identical outside the window.
 *   6. LATTICE — the set of cells written and the codes written into them, taken from the ORACLE
 *      at run time and required of the rewrite; plus the shape that set has to have, so a rewrite
 *      writing a different 896 cells could not pass by count alone.
 *   7. CALLS, NOT RESTATES — the module's text: it must name the stamp's file and call it rather
 *      than carry the stamp's own body, with that body as the control.
 *   8. EXCLUDED — the registers that move, bounded by a CEILING asserted as a subset, with the
 *      untouched ones asserted HELD and a positive control.
 *   9. WHOLE-MACHINE, CONVERGENT — and it does NOT come back clean, deliberately. See below.
 *  10. WHOLE-MACHINE TEETH — a do-nothing twin does not heal, so the convergence above is a
 *      property of the rewrite rather than of the instrument.
 *  11. TEETH — eight twins on exact counts.
 *
 * ★ WHY THE WHOLE-MACHINE ARM IS CONVERGENT AND NOT STRICT, WITH THE MECHANISM MEASURED BESIDE THE
 *   NUMBER. The oracle's own span is longer than what is left of the frame it starts in — the arm
 *   MEASURES the T-states it spends and the frame boundary it crosses — so the dump taken at that
 *   boundary catches the lattice PART-WAY on the oracle's side. The rewrite spends no T-states, so
 *   even with the oracle's cost handed back in one piece afterwards the same dump catches the
 *   lattice COMPLETE. That is the one frame the two disagree on in the character plane, and the arm
 *   pins it. Everything else is dead stack below the dispatch seat, and all of it heals. Handing
 *   the cost back per box instead would need this file to re-time the oracle instruction by
 *   instruction, which is the oracle.
 *
 * HOLE: ONE dispatch per session, in boot, so there is no variety in real machine state at all and
 * the crafted priors are doing all the discriminating.
 * HOLE: the cursor origin, the band count and the box count are constants no crafted entry can
 * vary. The twins vary them instead.
 *
