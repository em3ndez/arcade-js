/**
 * dispatchShotSweepByMotherShipArmed — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x4F35.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. One flag test, two cursor cells staged, and a tail transfer into the shared shot
 * sweep at ROM 0x5211 with the arguments the oracle marshals through registers. Both the sweep
 * and the other arm's entry at ROM 0x4FBF are ALREADY DECOMPILED, so the rewrite calls them
 * directly — with the arguments as real parameters — and dissolving those transfers belongs to
 * this caller's unit.
 *
 * ★ THE ORACLE RETURNS AND THE REWRITE DOES NOT, AND ON SOME ENTRIES IT ALSO PUSHES. This entry
 *   itself pushes nothing; the sweep it transfers into brackets each score it posts with a pushed
 *   return address, so DEAD STACK SCRATCH appears below the seat only on entries where a shot
 *   actually reaches something. The window is MEASURED — the WINDOW arm instruments the oracle's
 *   own `push16` over this file's whole sweep — never assumed and never copied from another gate,
 *   and the captured dispatches alone would have measured it as ZERO, which is exactly the
 *   too-narrow window a crafted hit is here to prevent.
 *
 * WHY THE LIVE-OUT IS MEMORY ONLY, derived from the ORACLE's exit successors and not from the
 *   module: the oracle's tail returns into the frame-service list at 0x11CF, whose very next act
 *   is the next `call` in that list, so no register this entry leaves is read before it is
 *   overwritten. Confirmed by running the tape: the oracle's pc after a captured dispatch is
 *   0x11CF.
 *
 * GATE: strict unit-capture replayed over every dispatch the tape produces, plus a CRAFTED grid,
 *   because the tape reaches this entry only with the flag clear and only with nothing colliding —
 *   both the other arm and every collision are unreachable without one. Each crafted machine is a
 *   real captured one with the shot slots, the target slots and the flag nudged.
 *
 *   1. EQUAL      — identical across the whole state dump outside the measured window, over every
 *                   dispatch the tape produces, and over every crafted machine.
 *   2. WINDOW     — the oracle's own deepest push, measured over the whole sweep and PINNED.
 *   3. BOUNDARY   — the exclusion is exactly as wide as it declares: one byte BELOW the window is
 *                   caught, one AT the entry seat is caught, one INSIDE is masked.
 *   4. ARMS       — both arms are really visited by the sweep, and the crafted grid really
 *                   produces hits as well as misses, so no arm below is scored on an unreached
 *                   path.
 *   5. THE RUN IS SEVEN LONG — measured on the ORACLE: the last two target slots of that run are
 *                   destroyed when a shot reaches them, and an eighth is not. That is the one
 *                   thing distinguishing this entry from its sibling arm, so it is measured rather
 *                   than asserted from the module.
 *   6. THE BOX    — the widest offset that still counts as a hit, measured per axis on the ORACLE
 *                   and identical on both axes.
 *   7. EXCLUDED   — no register outside the declared CEILING moves, with a two-sided control.
 *   8. CALLS, NOT RESTATES — the module's text: it must name each callee's file and call it rather
 *                   than carry that callee's body, with each callee's own body as a control.
 *   9. TEETH      — broken twins with measured catch counts over the sweep.
 *
 * HOLE: both callees are gated by their own files. What this file gates is the flag test, the
 * staging of the two cursor cells, and the arguments handed to the sweep.
 * HOLE: the crafted grid moves ONE target at a time against one planted shot and sweeps one axis
 * against a fixed other axis, so a candidate that crossed the two axes is caught only by the
 * swapped-axes twin's own arm.
 * HOLE: this gate pins the candidate's pc but leaves sp inside the excluded set, so a rewrite that
 * leaked stack without writing memory would pass here. assembled-swap.test.js owns that.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-4f35.test.js
