/**
 * loc_0d57 — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x0D57.
 *
 * Three constants and a tail transfer to the shared digit painter at ROM 0x0D73 (already
 * decompiled): the first character-plane cell, the high end of the packed-decimal field walked
 * downward, and the pen colour. The rewrite calls loc_0d73 directly; dissolving that transfer is
 * this caller's unit, and the painter is gated by its own file, so what this file gates is the
 * CHOICE of the three arguments and the dissolve.
 *
 * The oracle reaches the painter through `m.call`, so the painter's body pushes return addresses
 * below the entry seat and takes a return the direct call never takes — leaving DEAD STACK SCRATCH
 * below the seat and moving a, f, sp and pc (the declared ceiling). The window is MEASURED, not
 * assumed: the WINDOW arm instruments the oracle's own `push16` over the whole sweep and reports
 * the deepest stack pointer reached; a diff-derived window could not see a pushed byte that already
 * held its own value. Every other arm walks the whole dump and masks ONLY that window.
 *
 * A poisoned-plane comparison backs the strict one, which alone would rest on wrong evidence: at
 * the captured dispatch the run painted already matches the screen, so no plane cell changes and a
 * broken twin shows only in masked scratch. Filling both planes with a marker makes every written
 * cell visible; loading the two adjacent fields with different digits makes a wrong-field twin
 * diverge at a painted cell. Every twin is required to be caught inside the planes.
 *
 * HOLE: one captured machine; the run's position and colour are constants that cannot be swept, so
 * the twins vary them instead. This gate pins pc but leaves sp in the excluded set, so a rewrite
 * that leaked stack without writing memory passes here — assembled-swap.test.js owns that.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-0d57.test.js
