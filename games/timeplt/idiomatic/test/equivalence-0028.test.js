/**
 * retreatCharCursor — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x0028.
 *
 * GATE: unit-capture at the real dispatch, comparing RAM **plus a declared live-out**, because
 *   RAM ALONE IS VACUOUS HERE. The routine writes no memory at all: `unitEquivalence` reports
 *   `ram: null` for a bare `() => {}` exactly as readily as for the real thing, so a test
 *   asserting only that would be green and worthless. The BLIND arm makes that an assertion
 *   rather than a caveat, and every arm with teeth compares the cursor.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT is the cursor pair {d, e}, read off the seven call sites in five routines. Each site
 *   holds a tilemap address there across the call and a character code is written through it —
 *   directly after the call at 0x0E76, 0x0E82, 0x0EB7 and 0x0EB8, or by whoever called the
 *   routine that ends on the step at 0x0E9A, 0x0EAA and 0x0F04. The accumulator is NOT live at
 *   the three sites that reload it within two instructions; at the four tail sites it flows out
 *   through a return, and reading further would mean walking the call graph rather than the
 *   callers, so MEASUREMENT finishes the derivation — see LIVE-OUT (MEASURED). No site tests the
 *   flags this routine leaves before overwriting them. EXCLUDED is therefore {a, f, sp}, pinned
 *   by name so it cannot silently widen, and `pc` diverges too: the oracle ends by popping a
 *   return address into it and the rewrite, being ordinary JavaScript, does not.
 *
 * THE STACK IS NOT MODELLED, AND THAT COSTS SOMETHING MEASURABLE. Substituting this leaf
 *   one-for-one into the still-translated engine leaks two bytes per dispatch, and the engine
 *   follows a stale return address into unwritten space on the very frame it first draws
 *   characters. That is the known mixed-migration leak, not a defect here, and it resolves when
 *   the callers stop pushing. EXPECTED DIVERGENCE pins it as a measurement rather than a claim,
 *   and LIVE-OUT (MEASURED) shows the leak is the ONLY thing the missing return was buying.
 *
 * `r.equal` is never asserted: it folds in the register diff that memory-equivalence deliberately
 *   drops, so it is false for a CORRECT routine.
 *
 * What it exercises, holes stated:
 *   1. BLIND — the RAM half is proven vacuous, so it cannot be mistaken for the gate.
 *   2. EQUAL at the real dispatch — RAM identical AND the live-out identical.
 *   3. EXCLUDED — exactly {a, f, sp} move, plus pc; the cursor does not.
 *   4. DIRECTION — the step measured in PIXELS. A character painted through the stepped cursor
 *      lands one whole cell along the grid from one painted through the cursor as captured,
 *      which is what licenses calling this a one-cell step rather than an address bump.
 *   5. EXHAUSTIVE — all 65536 cursor values. The routine reads nothing else, so that is its
 *      entire input space, and it is the only arm that covers the carry into the high byte.
 *   6. CORPUS — every cursor the running game really presents over a driven tape, replayed, and
 *      confirmed to be a video-RAM address at every one of them.
 *   7. EXPECTED DIVERGENCE — the stack leak, measured and recorded.
 *   8. LIVE-OUT (MEASURED) — the dropped accumulator and flags reach nothing outside the stack.
 *   9. TEETH — five broken twins with exact catch counts. Two of them partition the cursor space
 *      on the carry, so between them they prove the gate agrees with the RIGHT theory about
 *      which cursors carry, not merely that it disagrees with a wrong twin.
 *
 * HOLE: the corpus is one tape of 1800 frames. It reaches live play, but not every screen the
 * game can draw, and the sweep is what covers the rest of the input space.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-0028.test.js
