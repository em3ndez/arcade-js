/**
 * serviceFixedSlotInEra1 — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x3DDA.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. A guard on the era index, then two constant record bases handed to the slot
 * servicer at ROM 0x3DEB — WHICH IS ALREADY DECOMPILED, so the rewrite calls serviceSlotByHeadByte directly
 * and dissolving that transfer belongs to this caller's unit. The guard is `dec a / ret nz` on
 * the era cell, so it passes on exactly one value and the rewrite writes that comparison out.
 *
 * ★★ EVERY REAL DISPATCH THIS GATE HAS EVER SEEN IS MEMORY-DEGENERATE, IN TWO WAYS AT ONCE. The
 *   driven sessions sit in an era the guard rejects, so they never get past the first line. The
 *   undriven session is in the era the guard accepts — at every one of its dispatches — but the
 *   slot it then services is EMPTY every time, so the servicer returns without writing. NOT ONE
 *   REAL DISPATCH IN ANY SESSION WRITES A BYTE, and the whole-run masked diff is consequently
 *   BLIND TO EVERY TWIN HERE, which is asserted per twin rather than glossed. The rewrite HANDS the
 *   two bases to the servicer as arguments and leaves no register behind, so nothing bites at a
 *   real dispatch either: THE CRAFTED CROSS IS THE ENTIRE GATE, and arms 2, 6 and 11 assert that
 *   rather than describe it — each with a control showing the instrument would have seen the thing
 *   it did not find.
 *
 * ★ LIVE-OUT, DERIVED FROM THE ORACLE, NOT FROM THE MODULE. One site reaches this entry: the
 *   fixed per-frame call list at ROM 0x1199, which calls it and returns to 0x11C3. That is
 *   `call 0x3E36`, and 0x3E36 begins `ld ix,0xA810 / ld iy,0xAA12` before calling 0x3E63, whose
 *   own first instruction is `ld a,(ix+0)`. So neither index register nor any other register this
 *   entry leaves is read, and nothing tests the flags. THE DECLARED LIVE-OUT IS MEMORY ONLY, and
 *   the DEAD AT EXIT arm measures it rather than citing it: wrapped in the all-frozen game, every
 *   register the oracle leaves complemented on the way out is unheard in any per-frame state (the
 *   stack page included but for two register-save slots it is pushed through, PUSHED_SAVE_SLOTS;
 *   assertDeadAtExit) over the era-1 session and the driven one, while a
 *   complemented stack pointer is heard in game data at once. So no
 *   register is compared; the choice of bases is held by the crafted cross, in memory.
 *
 * ★ THE ORACLE PUSHES ON THE SERVICED PATH AND NOT ON THE REJECTED ONE. The window is MEASURED by
 *   instrumenting the oracle's own pushes over the whole cross, not inferred from the diff.
 *
 * GATE: strict unit-capture with one measured exclusion, every replayed session at every
 *   dispatch, a crafted cross over the era, the slot's head byte and where the object sits, and
 *   a whole-run masked diff. Holes stated:
 *
 *   1. EQUAL at the real dispatch — identical outside the measured window.
 *   2. MEMORY-DEGENERATE AT THE REAL DISPATCH — a no-op is not caught there at all, and the SAME
 *      masked diff catches it on a CELL on a crafted serviced entry, so the silence is the corpus's
 *      doing and not the instrument's.
 *   3. WINDOW — the oracle's deepest push over the whole cross, measured.
 *   4. DEAD AT EXIT — no register the oracle leaves is heard anywhere but its pushed copies in
 *      PUSHED_SAVE_SLOTS (oracle,
 *      era-1 and driven sessions; assertDeadAtExit), with a complemented stack pointer as the control
 *      that is heard in game data.
 *   5. THE GUARD — every era value swept against a slot that would definitely be serviced; the
 *      set of eras the oracle acts on is asserted to be exactly one value.
 *   6. UNIFORM CORPUS — measured dispatch counts, the eras and head bytes every real dispatch
 *      arrives with, and the assertion that not one of them writes a byte.
 *   7. CORPUS — every dispatch of every session, which proves only that nothing broke.
 *   8. CROSSED — every head byte at each swept era and each of three placements.
 *   9. THREE ARMS REACHED — the cross is shown to drive all three of the servicer's arms, by
 *      classifying what the ORACLE writes at each head byte, so the sweep is not secretly one arm.
 *  10. CALLS, NOT RESTATES — the module's text, with the servicer's own body as a control.
 *  11. WHOLE-MACHINE — a driven session with the rewrite wired, diffed every frame. It catches
 *      NOTHING here, so it carries a control candidate that scribbles one sprite cell and must
 *      be seen; without that its clean verdict would be indistinguishable from an unwired arm.
 *  12. TEETH — a bank of twins, each with an exact catch count over the cross and per session,
 *      and its whole-run verdict recorded rather than assumed. Every one is whole-run BLIND, and
 *      the real-dispatch counts record which the memory-degenerate corpus can see at all. The
 *      crafted cross is what holds them.
 *
 * HOLE: the crafted records are seeded with a fixed synthetic pattern, not with states the game
 * produced; nothing here says the servicer is ever REACHED with a live slot in real play, only
 * what happens if it is.
 * HOLE: the two neighbouring slots and sprite entries are seeded so a mis-aimed twin diverges;
 * no arm sweeps the whole table of slots.
 *
