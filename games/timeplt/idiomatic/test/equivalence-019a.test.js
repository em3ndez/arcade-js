/**
 * armWholePlaneWipeThenDerailOnATamperedImage — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x019A.
 *
 * ★ IT IS DISPATCHED ONCE PER SESSION, and that is why the crafted arms carry this file. One
 *   `call 0x019A` exists in the image, at 0x15E2, on the boot path; measured over both tapes the
 *   entry runs exactly once. A gate resting on that single entry would be testing one prior value
 *   of two cells and one program image. CORPUS records the entry and guards vacuity; CELLS,
 *   ENTRY-STATE, BLOCK and TAMPER are what actually cover the input space.
 *
 * ★ THE TAMPER ARM IS THE ONLY WAY TO REACH THE FAILING BRANCH, so it is built rather than
 *   reasoned about. On a genuine image the check passes and the trap call is dead code, which
 *   means a rewrite that got the total, the run length, the start or the expected value wrong
 *   would be INVISIBLE to every arm that runs the real image. TAMPER clones a captured entry onto
 *   a PRIVATE copy of the program image with one byte changed and a probe standing in for the
 *   trap address, so the branch is exercised without executing the junk it lands in — and BLOCK
 *   walks the tamper to the first byte of the checked run, the last, and the bytes either side,
 *   so the run's extent is measured and not declared.
 *
 * ★ THE TRAP TARGET IS CAPTION TEXT, NOT DEBRIS. 0x0167 is a caption record — live bytes a table
 *   points at — which happens to decode as instructions and falls into the interrupt epilogue.
 *   The epilogue then unwinds a frame that WAS laid down, but ONE WORD OUT OF STEP, because the
 *   arm's own return word is never spent; it returns to a value that is not an address. That is
 *   the intent — a tampered image is derailed, not reported — and it is why the arms here replace
 *   the address with a probe instead of letting it run.
 *
 * What it exercises, holes stated:
 *   1. CORPUS — the real dispatch, whole state dump plus a register-ceiling check. Vacuity guarded.
 *   2. WINDOW — the oracle pushes nothing on the passing path, measured, with a control.
 *   3. CELLS — the two seeded cells over every prior byte value they could hold.
 *   4. ENTRY-STATE — crafted register entries, including the one that makes the loop counter move.
 *   5. BLOCK — the checked run's first and last byte trip the check; the bytes either side do not.
 *   6. TAMPER — a changed image sends both sides to the trap, the genuine one sends neither.
 *   7. EXCLUDED — nothing outside the declared ceiling moves, with a control twin.
 *   8. DRIVEN — the rewrite wired live for a whole session; divergence confined to dead stack.
 *   9. TEETH — six twins, each caught, with the arm that caught it named.
 *
 * HOLE: the wipe this entry arms is never run here. What the cursor and the counter mean is the
 * business of the routine that paints; this file only fixes what is written into them.
 * HOLE: TAMPER changes one byte at a time. A pair of changes that cancel in an eight-bit sum is
 * exactly what the check cannot see, and nothing here pretends otherwise.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-019a.test.js
