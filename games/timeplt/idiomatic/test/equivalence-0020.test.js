/**
 * advanceCharCursor — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x0020.
 *
 * GATE: unit-capture on the real dispatch, but the comparison is RAM **plus a declared
 *   live-out**, because RAM ALONE IS VACUOUS FOR THIS ROUTINE. It writes nothing; the whole
 *   effect is the cursor it leaves behind. `unitEquivalence` therefore reports `ram: null` for
 *   a bare `() => {}` as readily as for the real thing, and a test asserting only that would be
 *   green and worthless. The BLIND arm below makes that an assertion rather than a caveat.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT, derived from the callers rather than from the instruction sequence. Eleven routines
 *   reach this one. Every call site holds a tilemap address in the cursor pair across the call
 *   and writes a character code through it, so the pair is live everywhere — and the CORPUS arm
 *   confirms the pair really is a tilemap address at every dispatch the game makes. The
 *   accumulator is not live: at most sites it is reloaded within an instruction or two, at one
 *   it is exchanged into the shadow set and that copy is never brought back, and at five it
 *   flows out through a return, where reading further would mean walking the call graph rather
 *   than the callers. No site tests the flags this routine leaves before overwriting them.
 *
 *   Reading stops at those five sites, so MEASUREMENT finishes the job — see LIVE-OUT (MEASURED)
 *   below. EXCLUDED is {a, f, sp}, pinned by name so it cannot silently widen, and `pc` diverges
 *   too: the oracle ends by popping a return address into the program counter and the rewrite,
 *   which is ordinary JavaScript, does not.
 *
 * THE STACK IS NOT MODELLED, AND THAT COSTS SOMETHING MEASURABLE. The idiomatic layer lets the
 *   host language own the call stack, so this routine does not consume the return address its
 *   callers push. Substituting it one-for-one into the still-translated engine therefore leaks
 *   two bytes per dispatch and the engine dies on a stale return address. That is the known
 *   mixed-migration leak, not a defect here, and it resolves when the callers stop pushing —
 *   i.e. when they are idiomatic too. EXPECTED DIVERGENCE below pins the measurement so the
 *   claim is checked rather than asserted, and LIVE-OUT (MEASURED) shows that the leak is the
 *   ONLY thing the missing return was buying.
 *
 * `r.equal` is unused and stays false by design — it folds in the register diff that
 *   memory-equivalence deliberately drops.
 *
 * What it exercises, holes stated:
 *   1. BLIND — the RAM half is proven vacuous, so it cannot be mistaken for the gate.
 *   2. EQUAL at the real dispatch — RAM identical AND the live-out identical.
 *   3. EXCLUDED — exactly {a, f, sp} move, plus pc; the cursor does not.
 *   4. EXHAUSTIVE — all 65536 cursor values. The routine reads nothing else, so this is its
 *      entire input space, and it is the only arm that covers the borrow into the high byte.
 *   5. CORPUS — every cursor the running game really presents over a driven tape, replayed.
 *   6. EXPECTED DIVERGENCE — the stack leak, measured and recorded.
 *   7. LIVE-OUT (MEASURED) — the dropped accumulator and flags reach nothing the display reads.
 *   8. TEETH — four broken twins with exact catch counts. One is caught only by the sweep and
 *      the corpus, and that blindness is asserted rather than left implicit.
 *
 * HOLE: the corpus is one tape. It reaches live play, but not every screen the game can draw.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-0020.test.js
