 * loc_12e7 — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x12E7.
 *
 * GATE: strict unit-capture with NO exclusion — the frozen routine pushes nothing, so the whole
 *   dump including the stack is compared — plus a captured real corpus from four sessions, a
 *   sweep that is exhaustive over the routine's whole input space by decomposition, a whole-machine
 *   replay, and teeth.
 *
 *   WHERE THE LIVE-OUT COMES FROM. It is read off the frozen routine's exit successors, not off the
 *   rewrite. Both exits are tail jumps — to ROM 0x1226 and to ROM 0x0F1A — and each of those ends
 *   in a plain `ret`, so whatever they leave in the register file goes to whoever called THIS
 *   routine. This routine is itself only ever reached as a tail: ROM 0x12E2 falls into it after a
 *   `ret nz`, and ROM 0x330B ends `jp 0x12E7`. Neither of those two has any call site at all in the
 *   transcribed image, by either the mnemonic form or the `m.call` form — they are arms of an
 *   inline jump-table dispatch, which reaches an arm with `jp (hl)`. Traced with a probe on all
 *   three `jp (hl)` sites in the image, the driven session's one dispatch of THIS routine and all
 *   of its dispatches of ROM 0x330B came in through ROM 0x0B93's table and then ROM 0x0030's,
 *   nested; ROM 0x12E2 was not reached at all in that run. Arms of those tables leave wholly
 *   different register files from one another, so nothing downstream can be reading one. Hence
 *   memory-only, and the excluded register set below is a CEILING: the arm asserts no register
 *   OUTSIDE it moves, and stays green on a rewrite that becomes register-exact.
 *
 *   THE ENTRY IS SCARCE. Four sessions over six thousand frames each produce one or two dispatches
 *   apiece, and one produces none, so the crafted sweep and not the corpus is the load-bearing arm.
 *   Both counts are measured and pinned rather than described.
 *
 * What it exercises, holes stated:
 *   1. CONTRACT — the shared unit harness reaches the routine and the whole dump is identical.
 *   2. WRITE-SET — the addresses the frozen routine moves, measured across both arms.
 *   3. EQUAL at the real dispatch — the whole dump, stack included.
 *   4. NOT VACUOUS — a no-op FAILS the same diff, on a real cell.
 *   5. ARM REACH — how many dispatches each session produces and which arm each takes. The
 *      hand-over arm is reached by exactly ONE session; the same counter reporting the other arm
 *      present in every session that reaches the routine at all is the control for the others'
 *      zeros, and the undriven session's zero DISPATCHES is controlled by the three non-zero ones.
 *   6. CORPUS — every captured dispatch of four sessions.
 *   7. EXCLUDED, as a CEILING — over a cross, no register outside the declared set moves.
 *   8. INDEX SWEEP — all 256 values of the player index at a pair of counts the two arms answer
 *      differently on, so the branch is pinned for every index and not just the two seen.
 *   9. COUNT PLANE — all 65536 pairs of the two saved counts, at one index from EACH branch. With
 *      8 that is exhaustive over the whole input space.
 *  10. THE REUSED MACHINES ARE SOUND — clone-per-point whole-dump agreement on a sample.
 *  11. WHOLE-MACHINE — the two-player session with the rewrite wired, diffed every frame.
 *  12. TEETH — eight twins, each with an exact catch count over the sweep, over the real corpus and
 *      over the whole run. Several score zero on some sessions and one is caught by NO real
 *      dispatch and by no whole run either; all of those zeros are recorded rather than glossed.
 *      With one or two real dispatches per session the corpus cannot separate candidates that
 *      agree on the handful of states real play presents, which is why the sweep carries this gate.
 *
 * HOLE: the counts swept are the FIRST byte of each saved block; nothing here varies the rest of
 * either block, and nothing here establishes what else those blocks hold.
 * HOLE: the whole-machine arm runs one tape. A twin that only shows on a state that tape never
 * reaches is held by the sweep arms alone.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-12e7.test.js
