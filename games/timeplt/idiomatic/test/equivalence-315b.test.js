 * loc_315b — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x315B.
 *
 * THE DESTINATION REFUSES TO RUN, so this is a poked dispatch with negative controls, judged by a
 * hand-rolled two-clone run rather than unitEquivalence. 0x315B is three bytes, `jp 0x3176`, and
 * 0x3176 is a data table (seatEraSceneryRowThenClearAndRunScenery loads it `ld hl,0x3176` and indexes it with `rst 0x18`). Its
 * frozen transcription decodes DATA and throws on entry; the rewrite raises NotImplemented in place
 * rather than jumping there, so BOTH arms refuse — unitEquivalence cannot catch. The contract is:
 * the frozen side refuses, the rewrite refuses with NotImplemented (not any error), and neither
 * writes a byte first. A twin that still jumps into the table is caught, since the table's refusal
 * is not NotImplemented.
 *
 * WHY A POKE, AND WHAT IT IS. Two guards jump here (0x30E9, 0x30F5), testing sentinel bytes in work
 * RAM: 0xACC7 against 0x3B and 0xACC8 against 0x05 or 0x10, which routine 0x15FE plants from an
 * (address, value) table at ROM 0x163F — so on an untampered image both tests pass and this arm is
 * dead. Reaching the guards also needs the era index at or above four (0x30E0 diverts a lower one to
 * 0x3117). The poke is therefore two cells: ERA_INDEX held at four, and one sentinel byte zeroed.
 *
 * HOLE: this proves the rewrite arrives where the original arrives, and nothing more. It does not
 * execute the destination — the destination is not code — and it does not claim what a cabinet does
 * on arrival, where those bytes would be fetched as instructions.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-315b.test.js
