/**
 * seatCraftSlot1ThenDispatchByEra — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x28C2.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. Three instructions: two immediates loaded into the index registers, then a transfer
 * to the era dispatch. It pushes nothing for that dispatch to come back to, so the arm the era
 * picks returns past this entry and nothing of this entry runs after it.
 *
 * ★ HOW THE LIVE-OUT WAS DERIVED, and it is from the ORACLE and its call site — never from the
 *   rewrite. The oracle's only exit is that transfer, so its exit successor is the ARM: whatever
 *   the arm writes is this entry's product, and every arm below is RUN rather than compared as an
 *   address. The two index registers are the successor's INPUTS, not this entry's outputs, and the
 *   call site says so: the frozen caller reaches this entry from a run of siblings, and the next
 *   sibling re-loads BOTH index registers before its own transfer, while the two siblings that do
 *   not re-load them unconditionally read their condition out of memory rather than out of a
 *   register. So no register carries back across the seam, and the live-out is memory plus the
 *   arm's. The EXCLUDED arm below MEASURES which registers survive rather than declaring it, and
 *   it is a CEILING: nothing outside the declared set may diverge, and the set is not required to
 *   be filled.
 *
 * ★ THE COMPARISON IS MASKED BELOW THE EXIT STACK POINTER, and the CAUSE arm establishes the mask
 *   rather than assuming it. The frozen dispatch chain pushes and pops nested return addresses in
 *   the bytes just under the arm's frame and hands the arm different pointer bits besides; the
 *   rewrite reaches the same arm arithmetically and writes none of that. A PROBE TWIN that
 *   reproduces exactly that stack traffic and hand-off — and nothing else — leaves ZERO raw
 *   difference at every dispatch of all three sessions. That is what identifies the dead scratch
 *   as the whole of the difference instead of a story told about a number.
 *
 * ★ THIS ENTRY HAS THREE NEAR-NEIGHBOURS OF THE SAME SHAPE AND TWO THAT ONLY LOOK LIKE IT, and
 *   that is asserted here rather than assumed. Reading the family as one thing is how a gate that
 *   passes anything gets written, so two arms attack it: a NEIGHBOUR twin loads each sibling's
 *   immediates in place of this entry's and must be caught, and a GUARDED twin adds the
 *   memory-tested early return the two odd siblings carry and must be caught when that cell is
 *   set and NOT caught when it is clear. The second is the two-sided control: the instrument is
 *   shown able to see a guard in the same breath as it reports this entry has none.
 *
 * ★ THE RECORD THIS ENTRY AIMS AT IS IDLE THROUGHOUT BOTH PLAYED SESSIONS, and the measured
 *   counts say so plainly: neither the shared nor the driven session catches a candidate that
 *   does NOTHING. Those two sessions are therefore blind to most of the twins here, and the
 *   attract session is what holds them. A gate resting on the played sessions alone would pass
 *   almost anything at this address, which is the reason every count below is recorded per
 *   session rather than summed.
 *
 * GATE: strict unit-capture over three sessions, crafted arms, selectors and guard states off
 *   every kept entry, and a whole-run diff. What it exercises, holes stated:
 *
 *   1. DISPATCHED — each session's dispatch count, the eras it presents, and how many of those
 *      dispatches are INFORMATIVE, meaning the frozen side writes something outside the mask.
 *   2. EQUAL — masked RAM identical at every kept entry, raw difference reported.
 *   3. SCRATCH — every raw differing byte lies strictly BELOW the exit pointer and no deeper than
 *      the window, both asserted rather than assumed, and the mask is required to be measuring
 *      something.
 *   4. CAUSE — the probe twin above, which must leave nothing at all.
 *   5. CORPUS — every dispatch of all three sessions replayed.
 *   6. ARMS — all eight table entries off every kept entry, identical or faulting identically.
 *   7. SELECTOR — all 256 values of the era cell, so the five ignored bits are measured.
 *   8. GUARD — the two-sided control described above.
 *   9. STACK — exit pointer and program counter identical on every arm that completes.
 *  10. EXCLUDED — a ceiling on the registers that may diverge, plus the ones asserted HELD.
 *  11. WHOLE RUN — the rewrite dispatched for a whole session, cycle-matched, must leave the
 *      per-frame state byte-identical; uncompensated it may differ only in stack bytes.
 *  12. TEETH — twelve twins, each with an exact catch count per session and a recorded whole-run
 *      verdict. Nine of the twelve are caught by NO dispatch of either played session and by no
 *      whole run either; the verdicts record that instead of glossing it.
 *
 * HOLE: the sessions present eras 0, 1 and 2 and no other; the remaining selectors are crafted off
 * entries their era would not really produce, and where such an arm faults it is asserted only to
 * fault IDENTICALLY on both sides, never to be correct.
 * HOLE: two of the eight table words address nothing this port has transcribed, so of those two
 * the sweep can say only that both sides fault the same way.
 * HOLE: no kept entry of a played session is informative, so the crafted sweeps that need a
 * writing frozen side all rest on attract entries.
 * HOLE: this address has no registry entry, so nothing DISPATCHES the rewrite outside this file;
 * the WHOLE RUN arm wires it by hand for the length of one session and no further.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-28c2.test.js
