/**
 * seatTheStackAndSettleTheControlLatch — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x07B1.
 *
 * ★ READ THIS FIRST: THE STATE DUMP CANNOT SEE WHAT THIS ROUTINE DOES. Every write it makes goes
 *   to a device — the watchdog and the control latch — and the dump carries colour, video, work
 *   and sprite RAM and nothing else. A gate built out of `firstStateDiff` alone would pass a
 *   rewrite with the body deleted. That is not argued here, it is MEASURED: the LATCH arm runs a
 *   twin that leaves the picture switched off, shows the RAM dump byte-identical, and shows the
 *   device comparison catching it. Every arm below therefore compares the latch, the watchdog
 *   count and the unmapped-access counters alongside the dump.
 *
 * ★ THE CLEARING WALK IS INVISIBLE AT POWER-ON. The latch comes up with every line already low,
 *   so writing zero over it changes nothing observable — a rewrite that skipped the walk would
 *   pass at the one real entry. Two arms exist for that: the TAP compares the ordered list of
 *   device writes, and PRESET drives the lines HIGH first so the clearing has something to undo.
 *
 * ★ IT IS A TRANSFER, NOT A CALL, so the rewrite's `m.call(0x0069)` performs the caller's return
 *   itself and the candidate is wired RAW in the whole-machine arm, as _harness.js sets out.
 *
 * ★ ONE DISPATCH A SESSION, at power-on, from the reset vector. The crafted arms are where the
 *   coverage is; the corpus is a single point by nature and the REACH arm says so.
 *
 * What it exercises, holes stated:
 *   1. REACH — dispatch counts under both tapes, with the reset vector as the positive control.
 *   2. SEAM — the captured entry, both sides stopped AT the jump: the dump, the devices, the
 *      counters, the destination and every register outside the declared ceiling.
 *   3. LATCH — the arm described above, with its twin as the in-arm control.
 *   4. TAP — the ordered device writes, compared write for write, with a twin that drops the last
 *      address of the walk as the control that ORDER and LENGTH are really being read.
 *   5. PRESET — the same comparison from entries whose lines are already high.
 *   6. SOCKET — all 256 answers the expansion socket could give. Exactly one refuses, both sides
 *      refuse on it, and the other 255 run.
 *   7. SETTING — the image byte the picture line takes its level from, walked over all 256 values.
 *   8. REGISTERS — the entry register file scrambled, so the ceiling is measured and not guessed.
 *   9. TIME — the entry's own T-states, measured; one value, which the whole-machine arm charges.
 *  10. WHOLE-MACHINE — both tapes, the full frame budget, byte-identical with the rewrite wired.
 *  11. EXCLUDED — measured over the scrambles, with a control twin.
 *  12. TEETH — eight twins with their catch counts.
 *
 * HOLE: the walk's cursor and counter are in the ceiling, which is a statement that nothing
 * downstream reads them. No arm here reads the continuation to check that; what stands behind it
 * is the whole-machine replay, which runs the real session with them left unset and comes back
 * byte-identical, and the twins that show that replay able to go red.
 * HOLE: pc and the cycle count are not compared, the ordinary memory-equivalence drop.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-07b1.test.js
