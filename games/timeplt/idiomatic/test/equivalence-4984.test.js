 * pulseSlot1CoinCounter — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x4984.
 *
 * GATE: strict unit-capture, a corpus replay of a whole driven session, and an EXHAUSTIVE crafted
 *   cross over the two bytes the routine reads. Those two bytes ARE its whole input space, so the
 *   cross is complete rather than a sample. What it exercises, holes stated:
 *
 *   1. EQUAL at the real dispatch — the state dump agrees byte for byte, the stack scratch
 *      included, so this file names NO exclusion and asserts the empty one.
 *   2. THE DRIVEN LINE IS A LIVE-OUT AND IT IS NOT IN THE STATE DUMP. Driving it reaches a
 *      device, not memory, so every RAM arm here is blind to it. Each side is therefore run with
 *      device writes RECORDED and the two recordings compared in order — the LEVEL alone is not
 *      enough, because driving a line to the level it already holds leaves the level unchanged.
 *      Two of the twins below differ in nothing else, so the blindness cannot pass for coverage.
 *   3. EXHAUSTIVE — the full cross of four debt values against all 256 timer values, RAM and the
 *      recorded device writes compared on each.
 *   4. EVERY ARM REACHED, asserted rather than assumed: the cross is shown to contain entries
 *      that do nothing, entries that start a pulse, entries that drop the line, entries that pay
 *      a debt off, and entries that only count.
 *   5. CORPUS — every dispatch of a driven session, on a clone taken at the dispatch, with the
 *      arms the session actually reached reported rather than assumed.
 *   6. TEETH — six twins, each caught on its own exact count over the cross.
 *
 * HOLE: this gate says nothing about what the driven line DOES. It is one bit of an output latch
 * and nothing on this processor can read it back; the arm below compares the model's own record of
 * what was driven, which fixes the sequence and the timing and claims no more than that.
 * HOLE: the corpus never sees a debt above one, which the arm reports; multi-pulse behaviour is
 * covered only by the crafted cross.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-4984.test.js
