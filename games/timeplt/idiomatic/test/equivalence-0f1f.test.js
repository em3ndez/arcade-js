/**
 * dispatchSequenceSubStepArm — equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x0F1F, under the
 * DISSOLVED-DISPATCH contract.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. Read the sequence sub-step, keep its low nibble, run the arm that nibble names out of
 * the sixteen-word table that follows the entry, then run the fixed continuation every arm returns
 * into. The rewrite no longer parks the continuation as the arm's return slot and enters the arm
 * through the restart-vector dispatch; it switches on the nibble and calls each arm's idiomatic
 * module DIRECTLY, then calls the continuation. Every arm PLAIN-RETURNS, so nothing is pushed for it
 * and nothing is popped.
 *
 * ★ THE STACK IS STILL COMPARED, through the dispatch seam. In production this entry is reached
 *   through the game's `withOmittedRet` seam, which supplies the `ret` the rewrite omits. Every
 *   candidate here is run THROUGH that seam, so the exit stack pointer and the exit program counter
 *   are compared exactly against the oracle's — the oracle's continuation rets into the caller's slot,
 *   the seam does the same for the rewrite. A rewrite that left a pushed word behind (the missing- or
 *   extra-push class, invisible to a memory diff because the stray word lands in dead scratch) makes
 *   the seam THROW, and a thrown seam is a fault on one side only, which fails every arm below. The
 *   SP-TOOTH test proves this directly with a mutant that keeps the old parked return slot.
 *
 * ★ THE ONE LICENSED DIVERGENCE is a dead band of stack scratch just below the exit stack pointer.
 *   The oracle reaches its arm through a chain of nested calls that push and pop return addresses
 *   under the arm's frame, and its arms are the frozen transcriptions; the rewrite calls idiomatic
 *   arms, whose own sub-calls reach the stack to different depths. Transient scratch, dead the moment
 *   the routine returns. The band is MEASURED as an exact ceiling (CORPUS asserts it), the SCRATCH arm
 *   proves it is really there and that nothing escapes it, and the TEETH prove it is not over-broad.
 *
 * GATE: unit-capture at the first real dispatch, a replayed corpus of every dispatch of two sessions
 *   (coin-then-start and the undriven attract), a sweep of all sixteen slots and of the selector's
 *   whole byte, an idle-state arm that makes the continuation observable, an SP tooth, and teeth.
 *
 * HOLE: the sweeps force the selector off one captured machine, so an arm the sessions never select
 * runs against a state it would not really see; where that faults it is asserted only to fault
 * IDENTICALLY on both sides, never to be correct.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-0f1f.test.js
