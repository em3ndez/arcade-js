/**
 * loc_56d2 — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x56D2.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. Three sound codes, each fetched from a byte of the program image and offered to the
 * IN-PLAY-ONLY permission test at ROM 0x560C, and then a fall-through into ROM 0x56E4, which asks
 * for two more under a LOOSER test. ALL OF THOSE ARE ALREADY DECOMPILED, so the rewrite calls
 * loc_560c three times and loc_56e4 once, and dissolving all four transfers belongs to this
 * caller's unit. The fall-through is a plain call here, which is the same thing under
 * memory-equivalence.
 *
 * ★ THE TWO PERMISSION TESTS ARE DIFFERENT, AND THAT IS WHAT THIS GATE IS FOR. The three ask only
 *   whether a game is in progress; the trailing pair also accepts the cabinet's attract-sound
 *   setting. So there is a state — play inactive, attract sounds on — where the three are dropped
 *   and the pair is heard, and it is the only thing that can tell the two apart. NO REAL DISPATCH
 *   IN ANY SESSION ARRIVES IN IT: every one has both cells set. The SPLIT arm crafts it, asserts
 *   what lands, and carries a control twin that uses the loose test throughout.
 *
 * ★ LIVE-OUT, DERIVED FROM THE ORACLE, NOT FROM THE MODULE. Two sites reach this entry. ROM
 *   0x2010 calls it and returns to 0x202A, which begins `ld a,(0xABFE)`; ROM 0x43F0 calls it and
 *   returns to 0x4567, which loads HL, DE, B and C before reading any of them. No successor reads
 *   a register this entry leaves and neither tests the flags, SO THE DECLARED LIVE-OUT IS MEMORY
 *   ONLY. The rewrite nevertheless agrees on every register except the accumulator, the flags and
 *   the stack pointer, and the gate holds that as a CEILING — outside it fails, a rewrite that
 *   diverged on fewer still passes. It never requires a divergence.
 *
 * ★ THE ORACLE'S TAIL TAKES A RETURN. The frozen form runs on into ROM 0x56E4 and out through
 *   0x5617's own `ret`, so it performs exactly one net return and leaves the stack pointer two
 *   above its seat; the rewrite models no stack. That is why SP is in the ceiling, and the host
 *   shim supplies the one return on the rewrite's behalf.
 *
 * GATE: strict unit-capture with one measured exclusion, every replayed session at every
 *   dispatch, a crafted cross over both permission cells and the queue length, and a whole-run
 *   masked diff. Holes stated:
 *
 *   1. EQUAL at the real dispatch — identical outside the measured window. Its control is the
 *      arm below, on the same entry.
 *   2. NOT VACUOUS — a no-op FAILS that same masked diff, on a real cell.
 *   3. WINDOW — the oracle's deepest push over the whole cross, measured, not inferred from the
 *      diff; a diff-derived window cannot see a pushed byte that already held its own value.
 *   4. EXCLUDED — the registers that move over the cross, bounded by the ceiling, with an in-arm
 *      control twin that moves one outside it so the clean reading means something.
 *   5. UNIFORM CORPUS — measured dispatch counts and the permission state every dispatch
 *      arrives in, which is what shows the SPLIT arm is crafted-only.
 *   6. CORPUS — every dispatch of every session.
 *   7. CRAFTED CROSS — both permission cells against a range of queue lengths, including the
 *      lengths at which the count byte wraps.
 *   8. SPLIT — with play inactive and attract sounds on, the three are dropped and the pair
 *      lands; the codes that land are read out of the queue and checked, and a twin using the
 *      loose test throughout is shown to land all five there.
 *   9. THE DROPPED CASE — with both cells clear nothing at all is written, and the twin that
 *      skips the tests is shown to write there, so the silence is a finding rather than a hole.
 *  10. CALLS, NOT RESTATES — the module's text, with each callee's own body as a control.
 *  11. WHOLE-MACHINE — a driven session with the rewrite wired, diffed every frame, every
 *      differing cell asserted to be a stack address and the exact set pinned.
 *  12. TEETH — a bank of twins, each with an exact catch count over the cross and per session,
 *      and its whole-run verdict recorded rather than assumed. FOUR are recorded blind to the
 *      whole run, and three of those are ALSO invisible on every real dispatch: both twins that
 *      swap the two permission tests, and the one that skips them, only show in a state real
 *      play never presented, so the crafted cross is the ONLY thing holding them.
 *
 * HOLE: the five codes are constants of the image, so no arm here varies them; the twins send the
 * WRONG constants instead and the cross measures that it is seen.
 * HOLE: nothing reaches this entry in the undriven session at all, so everything real here comes
 * from the two driven tapes.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-56d2.test.js
