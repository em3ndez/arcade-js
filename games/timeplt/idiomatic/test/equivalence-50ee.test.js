/**
 * loc_50ee — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x50EE.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. A four-test guard and, when all four hold, four effects: two state bytes take a
 * destroyed code, a third cell beside them is cleared, and the chained hit score is posted. The
 * score routine is ALREADY decompiled, so the rewrite calls it directly and dissolving that
 * transfer belongs to this entry's unit. The oracle reaches it by a tail jump and takes its
 * return, which is why the whole-machine arms below wire the rewrite through the omitted-return
 * seam and one of them removes it on purpose.
 *
 * ★ NO TAPE DISPATCHES THIS ENTRY. The one site that transfers here does so only on the first and
 *   the last of the game's five eras, and every tape spends its whole budget on the second. So the
 *   corpus is MADE: the era cell is forced to the first for the duration of the caller's own
 *   dispatch and restored immediately after, identically on both sides of every comparison. The
 *   caller then transfers here for real, hundreds of times, on a real machine with real objects.
 *
 * GATE: nudged real dispatches, a crafted sweep of the whole decision space, and a whole-machine
 *   replay on three tapes. What it exercises, holes stated:
 *
 *   1. NEVER DISPATCHED — three tapes, zero dispatches each, asserted.
 *   2. NUDGED CORPUS — the counts per tape, every dispatch replayed, AND the guard outcomes
 *      counted: how many arrive with the first thing live, with both live, and with the first
 *      axis inside. The fourth test never once passes, so THE DESTROY PATH NEVER RUNS ON REAL
 *      DATA and the arm asserts that zero rather than letting the corpus read as coverage.
 *   3. EQUAL at a nudged dispatch, outside the dead stack window.
 *   4. NOT VACUOUS — a candidate that does nothing FAILS the crafted comparison. It does NOT fail
 *      on a nudged dispatch, which is arm 2's finding restated as a test.
 *   5. EXCLUDED, DELIBERATELY — the union of every register that differs anywhere in the crafted
 *      space, asserted as a set. The sprite-entry base register is in it: the oracle loads it and
 *      the rewrite does not, and the whole-machine arms are what show nothing downstream reads it.
 *   6. THE MASK IS LOAD-BEARING, MEASURED — the crafted entries where an unmasked comparison
 *      differs are counted, and the window they differ in is pinned to exactly six bytes below the
 *      entry stack pointer. Both numbers are asserted, so the window cannot quietly widen.
 *   7. EXHAUSTIVE — four live/dead combinations against each axis swept over all 256 coordinates
 *      from two bases, one of which makes the difference wrap. The count of crafted entries the
 *      ORACLE destroys on is asserted too, so an arm that stopped reaching the destroy path would
 *      fail rather than pass empty.
 *   8. WHOLE-MACHINE — three sessions, the rewrite wired through the omitted-return seam.
 *   9. TEETH/seam — the same wiring with the seam removed, which must die.
 *  10. TEETH — nine twins, each with an exact crafted count, an exact nudged count, and a recorded
 *      whole-machine verdict.
 *
 * HOLE: THE WHOLE-MACHINE ARM IS NEARLY BLIND HERE, and that is measured rather than argued.
 * Because no real dispatch passes all four tests, a session with the rewrite wired is identical to
 * an all-oracle one for every twin except the one that ignores the second thing's state — which
 * starts destroying things that are not there. Eight of the nine twins are recorded blind to it.
 * The crafted sweep is the load-bearing arm for everything this entry WRITES.
 * HOLE: the corpus exists only because the era cell was forced. Nothing here shows what the game
 * looks like on the eras that reach this entry naturally, only that the entry behaves identically
 * on the states the second era produces.
 * HOLE: the two coordinate bases in the sweep are chosen, not observed; the nudged corpus presents
 * a narrow range of real ones and the arm reports how many of them clear the first axis.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-50ee.test.js
