/**
 * loc_1f55 — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x1F55.
 *
 * GATE: unit-capture with ONE measured exclusion, a captured real corpus from three sessions, a
 *   sweep that is exhaustive over the routine's whole input space by decomposition, and teeth.
 *
 *   THE FROZEN ROUTINE PUSHES AND THE REWRITE DOES NOT, so the bytes just below the entry stack
 *   pointer are dead scratch on one side only. The push is not this entry's own — it belongs to
 *   the shape lookup it tails into — so the window is MEASURED here rather than read off the
 *   instruction stream: the WRITE-SET arm walks the whole dump and reports every address the
 *   frozen routine moves, and every later arm walks the whole dump too and asserts that nothing
 *   escapes the window. The first-differing-byte helper cannot express "differs only inside the
 *   window", which is why no arm in this file uses it.
 *
 *   WHERE THE LIVE-OUT COMES FROM. It is read off the frozen routine's exit successors, not off
 *   the rewrite. Its ONLY exit is a tail jump to ROM 0x20AF, which returns; that return lands in
 *   ROM 0x1F01 and ROM 0x1F42, both of which reach here as their own last act, and both are
 *   themselves reached as tails from ROM 0x1EDF. 0x1EDF has exactly two call sites, ROM 0x16AF and
 *   ROM 0x5694, and BOTH follow the call with `call 0x0F97`, whose first instruction is
 *   `ld a,(0xB411)`. 0x1EDF also has a bare `ret z` path that returns with an entirely different
 *   register file, so no caller can be reading one. Hence memory-only, and the excluded register
 *   set below is a CEILING: the arm asserts no register OUTSIDE it moves, and stays green on a
 *   rewrite that becomes register-exact.
 *
 * What it exercises, holes stated:
 *   1. CONTRACT — the shared unit harness reaches the routine. Its first-differing-byte verdict is
 *      NOT the contract here (see the window above); the masked arms are.
 *   2. WRITE-SET — the addresses the frozen routine moves, measured over a cross, split into the
 *      six cells and the scratch window. This is what licenses the sweep's machine reuse.
 *   3. EQUAL at the real dispatch — the whole dump outside the window, and the four stored bytes.
 *   4. NOT VACUOUS — a no-op FAILS the same masked diff, on a real cell.
 *   5. TAPE REACH — dispatches per session, measured.
 *   6. CORPUS — every captured dispatch of three sessions.
 *   7. EXCLUDED, as a CEILING — over the whole cross, no register outside the declared set moves.
 *   8. COMPONENT SWEEP — all 65536 values of EACH component in turn. The two stored words are
 *      written from disjoint inputs, which arm 2 measures, so sweeping each slot over its whole
 *      range is exhaustive over the pair rather than a sample of it.
 *   9. HEADING SWEEP — all 256 headings, which is the whole input space of the shape lookup this
 *      entry hands on to.
 *  10. THE REUSED MACHINES ARE SOUND — clone-per-point masked agreement on a sample.
 *  11. WHOLE-MACHINE — a driven session with the rewrite wired, diffed every frame. Measured, the
 *      set of differing cells is EMPTY, scratch included: the frozen side's two bracket bytes are
 *      overwritten again long before any frame boundary samples them. That is pinned rather than
 *      described, and each differing cell would also have to be a stack address.
 *  12. TEETH — eight twins, each with an exact catch count over the sweep, over the real corpus and
 *      over the whole run. Three are whole-run blind and two of those score zero on a session, all
 *      recorded, because the driven tape hands this entry ONE pair and the sessions differ in how
 *      much of the component space they present.
 *
 * HOLE: the corpus and every crafted entry take the pair from ONE seated machine; the sweep varies
 * the values handed over, never the record the shape lookup reads its heading out of.
 * HOLE: the component sweep holds the OTHER component at its captured value, so a defect that
 * needs a particular combination of the two would be seen only if it also shows at that value.
 * HOLE: the sweep compares the six written cells, not the whole dump, so a candidate writing a
 * SEVENTH cell is caught by the corpus and clone-per-point arms rather than by the sweep.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-1f55.test.js
