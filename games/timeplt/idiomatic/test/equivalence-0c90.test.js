/**
 * awardScoreToPlayer — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x0C90.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. Command-ring handler 4, the score-award: add the argument's award to the current
 * player's packed-decimal score, promote that score into the high score when it now beats it, and
 * repaint the scores it changed. Argument 0 takes a separate arm that only repaints the labels and,
 * one player only, blanks the second score. Every callee it reaches is already decompiled — the
 * empty exit, the two score painters, the high-score painter, the caption drawer and eraser and the
 * cursor step — so the rewrite calls all of them DIRECTLY and no `m.call` survives.
 *
 * ★ THE ORACLE PUSHES AND RETURNS AND THE REWRITE DOES LESS. Every transfer the oracle makes is an
 *   `m.call` over a `push16`; the dissolved calls push nothing, and the routine exits through a
 *   frozen `ret` the rewrite never takes. That leaves DEAD STACK SCRATCH below the entry seat and
 *   moves the accumulator, its flags, the byte pair BC and the stack pointer. The window is MEASURED
 *   off the oracle's own pushes over every arm and PINNED; every arm walks the whole dump and masks
 *   ONLY that window. Live-out is memory: the dispatcher reads only whether the handler returned
 *   normally, which it always does.
 *
 * GATE: strict unit-capture with one measured exclusion and every callee RUNNING, over the two real
 *   dispatches plus crafted entries for the arms the tape never reaches, plus teeth. Holes stated:
 *   1. EQUAL — both real dispatches identical across the dump outside the window and every register
 *      outside the declared ceiling.
 *   2. WINDOW — the oracle's deepest push over all arms, PINNED, so a change in its stack traffic
 *      turns this red rather than being absorbed by a wider mask.
 *   3. CRAFTED — the veto, the second player, the high-score promote and the two-player repaint,
 *      each forced by ONE poked cell identically on both sides, each shown to take its branch.
 *   4. BOUNDARY — the exclusion is exactly as wide as it declares: one byte below is caught, the
 *      seat is caught, one inside is masked.
 *   5. EXCLUDED — no register outside the ceiling moves, with a twin that scribbles one as control.
 *   6. DISSOLVED — the module's text: it imports and calls every decompiled callee directly, with
 *      no `m.call` surviving.
 *   7. TEETH — a twin for each way this could be wrong, each caught at a real cell.
 *
 * HOLE: the crafted arms force one cell for one dispatch, so they buy a real branch, not a realistic
 * session. HOLE: the stack pointer sits inside the excluded ceiling here; assembled-swap.test.js
 * owns SP over the whole run and this gate does not.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-0c90.test.js
