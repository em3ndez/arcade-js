/**
 * setMotherShipVelocityFromHeading — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x46BA.
 *
 * GATE: crafted-entry with a MASKED diff. Two things force that shape.
 *
 *   CRAFTED, because the shared coin -> start tape never dispatches 0x46BA — the UNREACHED
 *   arm runs the whole tape with a counting hook and asserts zero. So the entry is a REAL
 *   machine taken at a live dispatch of the per-record walk at 0x3E63, which leaves the
 *   index register on one of the object records this routine writes through, and the era
 *   selector is then forced across the entries the table defines.
 *
 *   MASKED, because the frozen twin reaches its arm through the ROM's restart-vector
 *   dispatch. That dispatch is nested calls deep; each pushes a return address into the
 *   stack bytes just below the slot the arm returns through and pops it again, leaving it
 *   as dead scratch, and the rewrite computes the same arm arithmetically without writing
 *   them. Every one of those bytes is BELOW the stack pointer both sides leave; WINDOW is
 *   the deepest the sweep finds and the SCRATCH arm asserts it, so the window cannot
 *   silently grow.
 *
 *   1. UNREACHED  — the tape really does not dispatch this address.
 *   2. EQUAL      — masked RAM identical on every era the table defines.
 *   3. SCRATCH    — the unmasked difference lies wholly inside the dead window.
 *   4. STACK      — the rewrite ends exactly one word deeper than the frozen twin, because it
 *                   calls the block past the table directly and that block's `ret` becomes a JS
 *                   return; the figure is pinned. Besides the stack pointer only the arm's own
 *                   walking scratch (a/f/h/l) may differ: the frozen arms walk the table in them,
 *                   the rewrite's arms hand back only the pair. The continuation reloads a and
 *                   the flags before reading them and hands h/l back untouched through a save and
 *                   restore, so the set is pinned and cannot quietly widen.
 *   5. ★ LIVE     — against the dispatch the live game ran before this rewrite, the table word
 *                   dispatched through the seam into the lifted arms with a slot parked for it:
 *                   every register, the stack pointer included, and all RAM outside that dead
 *                   slot are identical, so calling the arms directly changes nothing the game sees.
 *   6. ★ SEAM     — the rewrite is seam-placeable on every defined era and a direct call leaves
 *                   the stack where it found it; a control that parks a word nothing lifts is
 *                   refused, and one that dispatches the arm without a park drifts the stack.
 *   7. PAST       — the three indices past the table fault on both sides: two name no routine,
 *                   and the last runs the six-digit painter into a write the machine refuses.
 *   8. STORES     — the era really selects different stored values, so the sweep is
 *                   separating arms rather than agreeing on one outcome.
 *   9. TEETH      — four broken twins, each caught outside the window.
 *
 * HOLE: past the table only the fault is compared, not what each side wrote before faulting.
 * The entry is also the walk's dispatch rather than this routine's own, so the surrounding
 * state is one it is never really called with.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-46ba.test.js
