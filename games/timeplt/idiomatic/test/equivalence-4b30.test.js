/**
 * loc_4b30 — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x4B30.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. Three records of (source, destination) taken from a table in the program image; each
 * source cell is read twice, a fixed distance apart, and the pair is filed in two bytes at the
 * destination, second read first. Nothing else.
 *
 * ★ THE TABLE IS IN THE PROGRAM IMAGE, SO TWO OF THIS ROUTINE'S DECISIONS CANNOT BE OBSERVED HERE
 *   AND THE FILE SAYS SO RATHER THAN PRETENDING OTHERWISE. Both of its address steps are narrow —
 *   the plane distance is added to the source's high half alone, and the destination is stepped in
 *   its low half alone — so each would wrap inside a page rather than carry out of it. Neither can
 *   be made to happen: the table's three sources sit far from a page end and so do its three
 *   destinations. Two DECLARED-BLIND twins do exactly the wide-arithmetic thing, and their catch
 *   counts are asserted to be ZERO. That is a statement about the reach of this gate, not a pass.
 *
 * GATE: strict unit-capture at the one real dispatch, a crafted sweep of the six source bytes, and
 *   a whole-machine replay. What it exercises, holes stated:
 *
 *   1. EQUAL at the real dispatch — RAM byte-identical with nothing masked.
 *   2. NOT VACUOUS — a candidate that does nothing FAILS somewhere in the crafted space.
 *   3. EXCLUDED, DELIBERATELY — the union of every register that differs anywhere in the crafted
 *      space, asserted as a set. It includes the SHADOW accumulator, which the oracle parks a byte
 *      in and does not put back; nothing reads it, and the whole-machine arm is what holds that.
 *   4. CORPUS — the real dispatches replayed, with the count asserted.
 *   5. CRAFTED — 256 patterns over the six bytes this entry copies, so every one of the three
 *      records and both of its reads are varied independently of the others.
 *   6. WHOLE-MACHINE — the shared session with the rewrite wired through the omitted-return seam.
 *   7. TEETH — five live twins with exact counts, plus the two declared-blind ones above.
 *
 * HOLE: the destinations are three fixed cells and the sources three more. Nothing here varies
 * WHICH cells are copied, because the table that decides that is not writable.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-4b30.test.js
