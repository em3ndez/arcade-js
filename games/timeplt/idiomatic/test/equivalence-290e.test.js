/**
 * dispatchSeatedSlotByEraIndex — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x290E.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. Three instructions: read the era index, keep its low three bits, and enter the
 * restart-vector dispatch with the address of the word table that follows. Nothing is pushed for
 * the arm to come back to, so the arm's own return carries this entry's — which is why both sides
 * end with the SAME stack pointer and the SAME program counter, unlike a rewrite that merely omits
 * a return.
 *
 * ★ HOW THE LIVE-OUT WAS DERIVED, and it is from the ORACLE. Its exit successor is the ARM,
 *   entered as a jump: whatever the arm writes and whatever it leaves behind is this entry's
 *   product, and nothing of this entry's own survives it. So the live-out is memory plus the arm's,
 *   and every arm below is RUN rather than compared as an address. The registers the dispatch chain
 *   sets up on the way in are the arm's inputs, not this entry's outputs; the EXCLUDED arm measures
 *   which of them survive the arms rather than declaring it.
 *
 * ★ THE COMPARISON IS MASKED BELOW THE EXIT STACK POINTER, and the CAUSE arm establishes the mask
 *   rather than assuming it. The frozen chain pushes and pops three nested return addresses in the
 *   bytes just under the arm's own frame, and hands the arm different flag bits besides; the
 *   rewrite computes the same arm arithmetically and writes none of that. A PROBE TWIN that
 *   reproduces exactly that stack traffic and hand-off — and nothing else — leaves ZERO raw
 *   difference on every dispatch of both sessions. That is what identifies the dead scratch as the
 *   whole of the difference, instead of a story told about a number.
 *
 * GATE: strict unit-capture over two sessions, plus crafted selectors off each live arm. What it
 *   exercises, holes stated:
 *
 *   1. DISPATCHED — each session's dispatch count, the exact spread of eras it presents, and how
 *      many of those dispatches are INFORMATIVE. That last is not decoration: the arms walk a table
 *      of object slots and write nothing for an idle one, so about half the dispatches would pass a
 *      candidate that does nothing. The entry kept per era is the first that would NOT.
 *   2. EQUAL at a real dispatch of each live era — masked RAM identical, raw difference reported.
 *   3. NOT VACUOUS — a candidate that does nothing FAILS the same comparison.
 *   4. SCRATCH — across the arms and both corpora, every raw differing byte lies strictly BELOW the
 *      exit pointer and no deeper than the window, both asserted rather than assumed.
 *   5. CAUSE — the probe twin above, which must leave nothing at all.
 *   6. CORPUS — every dispatch of both sessions replayed.
 *   7. ARMS — all eight table entries off each captured entry, identical or faulting identically.
 *   8. SELECTOR — all 256 values of the era cell, so the five ignored bits are measured.
 *   9. STACK — exit pointer and program counter identical on every arm that completes.
 *  10. EXCLUDED — the registers that move, pinned to a set.
 *  11. TEETH — each twin required to be caught OUTSIDE the window, so the mask cannot be what is
 *      passing it.
 *
 * HOLE: the sessions present eras 0, 1 and 2 and no other. The remaining five selectors are
 * crafted off an entry their era would not really produce; where such an arm faults it is asserted
 * only to fault IDENTICALLY on both sides, never to be correct.
 * HOLE: two of the eight table words address nothing this port has transcribed, and the sweep can
 * say no more about those two than that both sides fault the same way — which is a statement about
 * the dispatch, not about the words.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-290e.test.js
