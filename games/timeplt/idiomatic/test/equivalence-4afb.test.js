/**
 * paintCreditCountPanel — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x4AFB.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. Three constants and a transfer: a pen colour, a first cell, and the address of one
 * packed byte, handed to the two-digit painter at ROM 0x0D81 — WHICH IS ALREADY DECOMPILED, so
 * the rewrite calls paintTwoUnsuppressedDigitsFromByte directly and dissolving that transfer belongs to this caller's unit.
 * Everything the caller was holding in those three registers is overwritten before it is read.
 *
 * ★ LIVE-OUT, DERIVED FROM THE ORACLE, NOT FROM THE MODULE. The call sites that reach this entry
 *   are ROM 0x189E, 0x2D3F, 0x3215, 0x4941 and 0x496E. Reading each successor: 0x18C0 tail-jumps
 *   to 0x172A, which loads the accumulator immediately; 0x2D49 loads DE and then the accumulator;
 *   0x3234 calls 0x4B30, which loads HL and B first; 0x4984 and 0x4987 both begin
 *   `ld a,(0xA981)`. No successor reads a register this entry leaves, and none tests the flags.
 *   THE DECLARED LIVE-OUT IS THEREFORE MEMORY ONLY. The rewrite nevertheless agrees with the
 *   oracle on every register except the accumulator, the flags and the stack pointer, and the
 *   gate holds that agreement as a CEILING — a register outside those fails, a rewrite that
 *   diverged on fewer still passes. That is strictly more than the contract asks and it never
 *   requires a divergence.
 *
 * ★ THE REAL CORPUS IS ALMOST CONSTANT. The packed byte barely varies across the sessions, and
 *   the panel is mostly already showing what gets painted, so much of what the oracle writes is
 *   what was there. The crafted sweep is what carries this gate, and the corpus arm measures the
 *   thinness rather than describing it.
 *
 * ★ THE ORACLE PUSHES AND THE REWRITE DOES NOT. The window is MEASURED, not assumed: the WINDOW
 *   arm instruments the oracle's own pushes over the whole sweep and reports the deepest stack
 *   pointer it reaches. Every other arm walks the whole dump and masks only that window.
 *
 * GATE: strict unit-capture with one measured exclusion, every replayed session at every
 *   dispatch, an exhaustive sweep of the packed byte crossed with hostile incoming registers,
 *   and a whole-run masked diff. Holes stated:
 *
 *   1. EQUAL at the real dispatch — identical outside the measured window. Its control is the
 *      arm below, which runs the same masked diff on the same entry and must FAIL.
 *   2. NOT VACUOUS — a no-op FAILS that same masked diff, on a real cell rather than a register.
 *   3. WINDOW — the oracle's deepest push over the whole sweep, measured, not inferred from the
 *      diff; a diff-derived window cannot see a pushed byte that already held its own value.
 *   4. EXCLUDED — the registers that move over the sweep, bounded by the ceiling above, with a
 *      twin that moves the cursor as the in-arm control that the measurement can see one.
 *   5. UNIFORM CORPUS — measured dispatch counts and which packed bytes real play presents.
 *   6. CORPUS — every dispatch of every session.
 *   7. EXHAUSTIVE — every packed byte against each incoming register set.
 *   8. DISCARDS WHAT ARRIVES — one packed byte painted with different incoming colours, cursors
 *      and pointers lands the same cells, and the colour-forwarding twin is shown NOT to, so the
 *      agreement is a property of the rewrite rather than of the comparison.
 *   9. CALLS, NOT RESTATES — the module's text, with the painter's own body as a control.
 *  10. WHOLE-MACHINE — a driven session with the rewrite wired, diffed every frame, every
 *      differing cell asserted to be a stack address and the exact set pinned.
 *  11. TEETH — a bank of twins, each with an exact catch count over the sweep and per session,
 *      and its whole-run verdict recorded rather than assumed. One is recorded BLIND to the
 *      whole run: leaving the plane bit off the cursor is overwritten by the caller, so only the
 *      register ceiling holds it.
 *
 * HOLE: the destination cells and the source byte are constants of the entry, so no arm here
 * varies WHERE it paints; the twins send it elsewhere instead and measure that the sweep sees it.
 * HOLE: the corpus is three tapes off one attract-and-play sequence, not every screen.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-4afb.test.js
