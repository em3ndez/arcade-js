/**
 * loc_5617 — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x5617.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS, AND WHAT SEPARATES IT FROM 0x560C. Same shape as its sibling — spill the command
 * byte, test permission, tail-jump into the enqueue body at 0x562A — but it tests TWO cells and
 * either one on its own admits the request. The first is the play-active flag its sibling uses.
 * The second is 0xA9C6, and the two entries are otherwise interchangeable, so what that cell IS
 * is the whole of the difference between them:
 *
 *   0xA9C6 is written exactly once in the image, by the boot-time switch unpack, and read exactly
 *   once, here. The unpack rotates the COMPLEMENT of the DSW1 byte and lands bit 7 in this cell.
 *   MAME's own port table for this driver gives DSW1 bit 7 as Demo Sounds, active low — and the
 *   same unpack's neighbouring fields corroborate that layout from the code side rather than by
 *   citation: bits 0-1 go through `and 3 / add 3 / cp 6 -> 255`, which is exactly the 3 / 4 / 5 /
 *   255 lives ladder the same table lists. So the second gate is the demo-sound switch, and the
 *   routine reads: sound during a game, or in attract when the cabinet is set to make noise.
 *   That is a claim the gate can test as behaviour, and the cross below does.
 *
 * ★ THE HOLE. Every dispatch the shared tape produces has the play flag SET and the demo switch
 *   ON, so neither the drop branch nor the second-cell-only branch ever executes on real data.
 *   With both cells admitting, every twin that differs only in WHICH cell it consults behaves
 *   exactly as the routine does: measured, FOUR of the five twins below are invisible at the real
 *   dispatch and only the do-nothing twin is caught there. An arm asserts that list rather than
 *   describing it. So the crafted cross is not a supplement here — it is the entire coverage of
 *   this gate, and the real dispatch's agreement is worth almost nothing on its own.
 *
 * GATE: strict unit-capture at the real dispatch, plus an exhaustive crafted cross. What it
 *   exercises, holes stated:
 *
 *   1. EQUAL at the real dispatch — RAM identical outside the scratch window named in 2.
 *   2. THE DEAD SCRATCH IS THE ONE EXCLUSION, PINNED to [SP-6, SP), an upper bound: at the real
 *      entry only one byte inside it actually differs, because the pushed bytes happened to match
 *      what was already there. That is why the arm asserts CONTAINMENT and never equality.
 *   3. REGISTERS AND PC ARE EXCLUDED, DELIBERATELY, and pinned to a fixed shape.
 *   4. EXHAUSTIVE over the full cross of both cells — play 0..255 against both switch settings.
 *   5. THE TRUTH TABLE, read back from the oracle: it drops when and only when BOTH are clear.
 *      This is the arm that would have failed had the two cells been ANDed, or had the second
 *      been ignored, and it is what makes the sibling distinction a measurement.
 *   6. EXHAUSTIVE over the queue length, 0..255.
 *   7. TEETH — five twins, plus the pinned list of which the real dispatch cannot see.
 *
