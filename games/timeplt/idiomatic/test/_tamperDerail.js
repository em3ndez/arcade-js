/**
 * Test-only instruments for the two anti-tamper derails whose landings have no faithful routine form.
 *
 * On a failed guard the frozen oracle transfers into bytes that destroy the stack frame: the
 * copyright-colour walk jumps into a caption record decoded as code (0x49fa), and the wrong-glyph
 * checks jump into the warp/flash step's misaligned prologue (0x459b). The rewrites raise
 * NotImplemented at those transfers instead, naming the module that stands for the landing. What the
 * two sides then do is not comparable (the oracle faults somewhere inside the garbage, the rewrite
 * at the entry), so a gate compares them AT the transfer:
 *
 * stopAtDerails(m) — arm a clone so the ORACLE stops on entry to either landing. It gets its own
 *   routine map (a clone shares its parent's), with each landing replaced by a probe that throws
 *   `DerailReached`. Everything the oracle does before the transfer runs unchanged.
 *
 * derailOf(e) — which landing a fault names: the probe's address on the oracle side; on the rewrite
 *   side, the landing whose module a NotImplemented message names. null for any other fault, so a
 *   stray crash never passes for a derail.
