/**
 * seatCraftSlot4ThenDispatchByEra — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x28E3.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. Two instructions that load an object record and a sprite entry, and a tail jump into
 * the era-keyed per-slot handler at 0x290E, which is ALREADY DECOMPILED — so the rewrite calls it
 * directly and dissolving that transfer belongs to this caller's unit. The whole content of the
 * entry is the CHOICE OF PAIR.
 *
 * ★ HOW THE LIVE-OUT WAS DERIVED, AND IT IS FROM THE ORACLE. The oracle has ONE exit: a transfer
 *   into 0x290E with nothing parked for it to come back to, so the arm 0x290E selects returns past
 *   this entry and the arm's product IS this entry's product. Live-out is therefore memory plus
 *   whatever the arm leaves. Reading the ORACLE's successors settles the registers: the return lands
 *   on the next of the seven sibling calls the caller makes, whose ROM form opens `ld a,(0xAD0D)` /
 *   `and a`, so A is overwritten and F set from it before either is read; and whichever way that
 *   sibling and the one after it go, the chain's own return lands on a call whose target opens
 *   `ld a,(0xB411)` / `bit 7,a`, which does the same again. Nothing on that path reads D, E, H or L.
 *   What the successors DO consume is memory. The index pair is left exactly as the oracle leaves
 *   it, which the EXCLUDED arm asserts rather than argues; that arm measures the moving set too,
 *   rather than declaring it.
 *
 * ★ THE STACK COMPARISON IS MASKED BELOW THE ENTRY POINTER, AND THE CAUSE ARM ESTABLISHES WHY. The
 *   frozen 0x290E chain reaches its arm through a restart vector, pushing and popping nested return
 *   addresses in the bytes just under the frame; the rewrite computes the same arm arithmetically
 *   and writes none of that. A PROBE — this entry's own two loads, then the FROZEN chain — leaves
 *   ZERO raw difference, unmasked, on every real dispatch and every crafted entry. That identifies
 *   the dissolved chain as the whole of the masked difference, rather than telling a story about it.
 *
 * ★ SP AND pc BELONG TO THE DISPATCH SEAM. The oracle nets exactly one return, through the arm; the
 *   rewrite performs none. `withOmittedRet` MEASURES which shape a dispatch took and supplies the
 *   missing pop, so the candidate is run THROUGH it here, as an assembled run reaches it, and SP and
 *   pc are then compared for EQUALITY everywhere. Nothing in this file asserts that the candidate
 *   DIFFERS from the oracle anywhere.
 *
 * GATE: strict unit-capture over every dispatch of two real sessions, a crafted cross over the era
 *   selector and the Mother-Ship gate byte, and a whole-machine replay. What it exercises, holes
 *   stated:
 *   1. REACH — dispatch counts, eras and gate byte presented, all measured, with a positive control.
 *   2. EQUAL — at the first INFORMATIVE dispatch of each session: masked RAM, SP and pc identical.
 *   3. NOT VACUOUS — a candidate that does nothing FAILS that same comparison.
 *   4. CAUSE — the probe above, which must leave nothing at all.
 *   5. SCRATCH — every raw difference lies strictly BELOW the entry pointer and no deeper than the
 *      window, both asserted; and at least one is seen, so the mask is not decorative.
 *   6. CORPUS — every dispatch of both sessions replays identically.
 *   7. CROSS — two captured bases crossed with four gate-byte values and all 256 era values.
 *   8. ARMS — the eight words of the handler table, with the two this port has not transcribed
 *      required to fault IDENTICALLY on both sides rather than to be correct.
 *   9. EXCLUDED — the registers that move, bounded by a CEILING asserted as a subset so a rewrite
 *      that agrees MORE closely cannot fail; the pair, both scratch registers and SP asserted held;
 *      and a positive control showing the instrument catches a held register being clobbered.
 *  10. WHOLE-MACHINE — a wired session of each tape, differing only in dead stack bytes.
 *  11. WHOLE-MACHINE TEETH — the same instrument shown catching a do-nothing twin.
 *  12. TEETH — seven twins, each with an exact crafted catch count and an exact real count per
 *      session, so a twin no real dispatch can see is recorded as such rather than passing quietly.
 *      One is: the twin that always runs the FIRST arm is invisible to every coin-start dispatch,
 *      because the era that tape holds selects that arm anyway. The crafted cross is what holds it.
 *
 * HOLE: both sessions present ONE era each, and between them only two of the eight arms run for
 * real. The other six are reached by poking the era cell on a real captured machine, and two of
 * those address nothing this port has transcribed — of those two the cross can say no more than
 * that both sides fault the same way, which is a statement about the dispatch and not about them.
 * HOLE: the record and sprite-entry addresses are constants, so no crafted entry varies them. What
 * varies is the machine they are read against.
 * HOLE: the whole-machine arm sees only what changes the FRAME dumps; a twin whose damage is
 * confined to the same dead stack bytes would pass it. The unit arms are what hold the pair.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-28e3.test.js
