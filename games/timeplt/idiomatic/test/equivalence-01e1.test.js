 * armThePenRouteThenColdStartOnATamperedImage — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x01E1.
 *
 * ★ THREE CALL SITES, ONE OR TWO DISPATCHES A SESSION. `call 0x01E1` appears at 0x076A, 0x3333
 *   and 0x3396; measured through our own harness the entry runs twice over the driven tape and
 *   once over the undriven demo. A gate resting on that would be testing one prior state of three
 *   cells against one program image, so CELLS, SEEDS, BLOCK and TAMPER are what carry this file.
 *
 * ★ THE SEEDED COORDINATES ARE NOT LITERALS, and SEEDS is what establishes it. Each is read out
 *   of a fixed pair of program bytes, so a rewrite that hard-coded the two values it happens to
 *   find there would pass every arm that runs the genuine image. SEEDS edits those bytes in a
 *   private copy of the image and requires both sides to follow — which is also a positive
 *   control that the private-image machinery below really does change what the entry reads.
 *
 * ★ THE FAILING BRANCH IS UNREACHABLE ON A GENUINE IMAGE, so it is built rather than reasoned
 *   about. The check's trap is the cold-start entry, which wipes the machine's whole state; TAMPER
 *   replaces that address with a probe and changes one image byte, so the branch is exercised
 *   without the wipe running. BLOCK walks the tamper to the first byte of the checked run, the
 *   last, and the bytes either side, so the run's extent is measured rather than declared.
 *
 * What it exercises, holes stated:
 *   1. CORPUS — every real dispatch, whole state dump plus a register-ceiling check. Vacuity
 *      guarded, and the entry is shown not to be degenerate.
 *   2. WINDOW — the oracle pushes nothing on the passing path, measured, with a control.
 *   3. CELLS — the three seeded cells over every prior byte value they could hold.
 *   4. SEEDS — the two coordinates are read from the image, not baked in.
 *   5. ENTRY-STATE — crafted register entries, including the one that makes the counter move.
 *   6. BLOCK — the checked run's first and last byte trip the check; the bytes either side do not.
 *   7. TAMPER — a changed image sends both sides to the trap, the genuine one sends neither.
 *   8. EXCLUDED — nothing outside the declared ceiling moves, with a control twin.
 *   9. DRIVEN — the rewrite wired live for a whole session; divergence confined to dead stack.
 *  10. TEETH — six twins, each caught, with the arm that caught it named.
 *
 * HOLE: what the pen then DOES with those cells is not exercised here. This entry only parks it;
 * the walking, the stamping and the route table belong to the routines that read them.
 * HOLE: TAMPER changes one byte at a time. A pair of changes that cancel in an eight-bit sum is
 * exactly what the check cannot see, and nothing here pretends otherwise.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-01e1.test.js
