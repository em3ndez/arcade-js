 * stepShapeAnimation — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x323A.
 *
 * GATE: every dispatch of two real tapes replayed, plus an exhaustive crafted sweep of the two
 *   record bytes that decide the outcome. What it exercises, holes stated:
 *
 *   1. CORPUS — every dispatch of the shared coin -> start tape and of undriven attract, each a
 *      whole-state-dump comparison outside the scratch window.
 *   2. THE DEAD STACK SCRATCH IS THE ONE EXCLUSION, pinned to [SP-4, SP): the oracle pushes a
 *      return address for each of the two lookups it delegates, and the rewrite models no stack.
 *      Every arm walks the whole dump and asserts nothing escapes it.
 *   3. REGISTERS AND PC ARE EXCLUDED, DELIBERATELY, as a ceiling: the flag byte and sp, the dead
 *      table pointer in d/e, and the new count in c and the entry pointer in h/l that the two
 *      frozen lookups leave behind. The rewrite hands the count and the pointer to the lookups as
 *      arguments and leaves no register behind, so the accumulator is the only register held.
 *   3a. DEAD AT EXIT — c, h and l flipped on the FROZEN game at every exit of this routine, over a
 *      coin-start session and undriven attract, change nothing, while flipping SP at the same exit
 *      is heard. That is the ORACLE's word that nobody reads what the rewrite no longer leaves.
 *   4. THE EARLY EXIT IS A REAL BRANCH — a timer already at zero must leave the whole dump
 *      untouched, which is measured off the ORACLE rather than assumed from the rewrite.
 *   5. EXHAUSTIVE — all 256 timer values crossed with a spread of run selectors, on a painted
 *      record so both the timer and the shape byte are visible wherever they land.
 *   6. THE RUN IS WALKED BACKWARDS — the shape byte for two adjacent timer values comes from two
 *      adjacent entries of the run, in the direction counting down implies. Asserted against
 *      poked run bytes, so it could have come out the other way.
 *   7. TEETH — eight twins, each with its exact catch count over the sweep. The no-floor twin's
 *      count of four is the whole of the branch it breaks: it differs only where the timer is
 *      already zero, which is one entry of the sweep per selector. The three wrong-entry twins are
 *      caught only where the wrong entry holds a different shape byte (see TWINS).
 *
 * HOLE: the corpus presents a narrow set of selectors, asserted as a set, so the sweep is what
 * covers the rest. Nothing here says what a shape byte draws, nor which records this is run on.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-323a.test.js
