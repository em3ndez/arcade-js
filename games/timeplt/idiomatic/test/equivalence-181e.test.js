/**
 * loc_181e — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x181E.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. One step of a screen-clearing sequence: every sprite parked out of sight, one
 * character cell's glyph and colour copied into a fixed record, the line wipe armed, and the
 * sequence's inner index stepped. All four routines it reaches are already decompiled, so every
 * call and the closing transfer are dissolved into direct calls in the rewrite.
 *
 * ★ IT IS AN ARM OF AN INLINE JUMP TABLE, not a call target, and the REACHED arm derives that from
 *   the image rather than taking it on trust. Every absolute call, jump and sixteen-bit load
 *   carries its target as a little-endian word, and so does a table pointer, so one scan over every
 *   byte offset covers all of them; the relative forms are scanned apart. The address is spelled
 *   exactly twice: once as the first word of the table just past 0x17FE, and once straddling two
 *   entries of an unrelated run of byte pairs, whose structure is asserted so that the second hit
 *   is shown not to be a pointer rather than waved away. A control address the image plainly calls
 *   is scanned alongside, so a quiet zero cannot pass for a finding.
 *
 * ★ HOW THIS FILE HANDLES THE MISSING RETURN, and why the neighbouring entry's reasoning is NOT
 *   reused. 0x17FE omits a push its own oracle performs, because the arm it dispatches returns
 *   through the slot it would have pushed. THIS file is that arm, and its position is different:
 *   its oracle ends by transferring into a routine that returns for it, so the oracle nets exactly
 *   one return and the rewrite performs none — the plain omitted-return shape. It parks nothing,
 *   because every routine it reaches is already lifted, so no still-frozen callee is left waiting
 *   for a slot to pop. The candidate is therefore run THROUGH the dispatch seam, which MEASURES
 *   what the rewrite did to the stack and throws if it is neither recognised shape, and SP and pc
 *   are compared for EQUALITY below. Nothing in this file asserts that the candidate DIFFERS from
 *   the oracle anywhere.
 *
 * ★ THE REAL ENTRY IS PARTLY IDEMPOTENT and the gate says so instead of hiding it: the record this
 *   entry copies into ALREADY holds the glyph and colour it is about to write, so the copy is
 *   invisible there and only the crafted entries hold it. The IDEMPOTENT arm asserts that, and the
 *   twin that drops the copy is recorded as caught by the crafted cross and by no real dispatch.
 *
 * GATE: crafted-entry over the four things this entry reads or overwrites, plus the single real
 *   dispatch and a whole-machine replay. What it exercises, holes stated:
 *
 *   1. REACHED — nothing branches to this address; the table word is shown to be it; the second
 *      spelling is shown to be a straddle; and the corpus arm counts the dispatches the game makes.
 *   2. EQUAL at the real dispatch — RAM outside the dead stack window, SP and pc all identical.
 *   3. NOT VACUOUS — a do-nothing twin FAILS that same comparison at the real entry.
 *   4. IDEMPOTENT — the sample write is asserted invisible at the real entry, so the crafted
 *      cross is known to be load-bearing rather than assumed to be.
 *   5. SEAM — SP and pc agree on the real dispatch and on every crafted entry.
 *   6. EXCLUDED — the registers that move are reported and bounded by a CEILING, asserted as a
 *      subset rather than an equality so a rewrite agreeing MORE closely cannot fail. SP, pc and
 *      both index registers are asserted to be outside it.
 *   7. CRAFTED — a cross over the sampled cell's two bytes, what the record already held, what the
 *      sprite band already held, the index being stepped (the wrap included) and what the wipe
 *      cells already held.
 *   8. EFFECTS — the oracle is shown to reach all four of its parts on the cross, so a crafted
 *      entry that exercised only one of them could not pass for coverage.
 *   9. CORPUS — the one real dispatch, with the demo asserted to make none.
 *  10. WHOLE-MACHINE — a driven session with the rewrite wired through the seam, differing only in
 *      dead stack bytes, and the same instrument shown CATCHING a do-nothing twin.
 *  11. TEETH — eight twins, each with an exact crafted catch count and its verdict on the one real
 *      dispatch recorded, the one the real dispatch cannot see included.
 *
 * HOLE: one captured machine and one dispatch. What the sequence does either side of this step is
 * not exercised, and neither is a second visit — the game makes exactly one in the corpus budget.
 * HOLE: the sampled record's consumer is not reached here, so nothing in this file says what the
 * copied pair is later used for.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-181e.test.js
