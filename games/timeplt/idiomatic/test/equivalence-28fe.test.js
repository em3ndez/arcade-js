/**
 * loc_28fe — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x28FE.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. A one-byte gate, then two instructions that load an object record and a sprite entry,
 * then a tail jump into the era-keyed per-slot handler at 0x290E, which is ALREADY DECOMPILED — so
 * the rewrite calls it directly and dissolving that transfer belongs to this caller's unit. The
 * content of the entry is the GATE and the CHOICE OF PAIR.
 *
 * ★ HOW THE LIVE-OUT WAS DERIVED, AND IT IS FROM THE ORACLE. The oracle has TWO exits. The open one
 *   is a transfer into 0x290E with nothing parked for it to come back to, so the arm 0x290E selects
 *   returns past this entry and the arm's product IS this entry's product: live-out is memory plus
 *   whatever the arm leaves. The closed one is a conditional return, and reading the ORACLE's
 *   successor settles what survives it — this entry is the LAST of a chain of seven sibling calls,
 *   so its return lands on that chain's own return, and from there on a call whose target opens
 *   `ld a,(0xB411)` / `bit 7,a`: A is overwritten and F is set from it before either is read.
 *   Nothing on either successor path reads D, E, H or L. So the live-out of the closed exit is
 *   memory alone, and the EXCLUDED arm measures the register set rather than declaring it.
 *
 * ★ THE CLOSED EXIT IS CRAFTED-ONLY, AND THE REACH ARM PROVES IT. Both tapes present the gate byte
 *   as zero at EVERY dispatch, so no real dispatch takes it; it is reached by poking that one cell
 *   on a real captured machine, identically on both sides. A, F and the return itself therefore
 *   differ on no real dispatch at all — the EXCLUDED ceiling carries A and F for the crafted arm.
 *
 * ★ THE STACK COMPARISON IS MASKED BELOW THE ENTRY POINTER, AND THE CAUSE ARM ESTABLISHES WHY. The
 *   frozen 0x290E chain reaches its arm through a restart vector, pushing and popping nested return
 *   addresses in the bytes just under the frame; the rewrite computes the same arm arithmetically
 *   and writes none of that. A PROBE — this entry's own gate and two loads, then the FROZEN chain —
 *   leaves ZERO raw difference, unmasked, on every real dispatch and every crafted entry. That
 *   identifies the dissolved chain as the whole of the masked difference.
 *
 * ★ SP AND pc BELONG TO THE DISPATCH SEAM, AND THIS ROUTINE TAKES BOTH SHAPES. Open, the oracle nets
 *   one return through the arm; closed, it performs its own. The rewrite performs neither.
 *   `withOmittedRet` MEASURES which shape a dispatch took and supplies the missing pop, so the
 *   candidate is run THROUGH it here, as an assembled run reaches it, and SP and pc are then
 *   compared for EQUALITY on both arms. Nothing in this file asserts that the candidate DIFFERS
 *   from the oracle anywhere.
 *
 * GATE: strict unit-capture over every dispatch of two real sessions, a crafted cross over the era
 *   selector and the gate byte, and a whole-machine replay. What it exercises, holes stated:
 *
 *   1. REACH — dispatch counts, the eras the sessions present and the gate byte they present, all
 *      measured, with a positive control that the collector can read another value.
 *   2. EQUAL — at the first INFORMATIVE dispatch of each session: masked RAM, SP and pc identical.
 *   3. NOT VACUOUS — a candidate that does nothing FAILS that same comparison.
 *   4. GATE — over the cross, a raised gate byte leaves memory untouched on BOTH sides, and a clear
 *      one is shown to write, so the two outcomes are both exercised rather than assumed.
 *   5. CAUSE — the probe above, which must leave nothing at all.
 *   6. SCRATCH — every raw difference lies strictly BELOW the entry pointer and no deeper than the
 *      window, and at least one is seen.
 *   7. CORPUS — every dispatch of both sessions replays identically.
 *   8. CROSS — two captured bases crossed with four gate-byte values and all 256 era values.
 *   9. ARMS — the eight words of the handler table, with the two this port has not transcribed
 *      required to fault IDENTICALLY on both sides rather than to be correct.
 *  10. EXCLUDED — the registers that move, bounded by a CEILING asserted as a subset; the pair, both
 *      scratch registers and SP asserted held; and a positive control that the instrument catches a
 *      held register being clobbered.
 *  11. WHOLE-MACHINE — a wired session of each tape, differing only in dead stack bytes.
 *  12. WHOLE-MACHINE TEETH — the same instrument shown catching a do-nothing twin.
 *  13. TEETH — ten twins, each with an exact crafted catch count and an exact real count per
 *      session. THREE are blind to real dispatches and are recorded rather than left to look like
 *      coverage: the twin that drops the gate altogether is caught by ZERO real dispatches in
 *      EITHER session, which follows from the gate byte never being raised in either; and the twin
 *      that always runs the first arm and the twin that gates on the era cell are both invisible to
 *      every coin-start dispatch, because the era that tape holds is the one that makes each of
 *      them agree. The crafted cross is what holds all three.
 *
 * HOLE: both sessions present ONE era each, and between them only two of the eight arms run for
 * real. The other six are reached by poking the era cell, and two of those address nothing this
 * port has transcribed — of those two the cross can say no more than that both sides fault alike.
 * HOLE: the closed exit is never observed in real play, so everything this file says about it rests
 * on crafted entries and on reading the oracle.
 * HOLE: the record and sprite-entry addresses are constants, so no crafted entry varies them.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-28fe.test.js
