/**
 * drainBothDeferredCellLists — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x5286.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. One pass of the deferred cell machinery: run the eraser, run the painter, then copy
 * the pending list wholesale onto the erase one, stamping the count with a mark, and parking the
 * pending cursor back on its first entry. The copy runs ONE WAY on every pass and never back, so
 * this is not a swap and the pair is not a double buffer. All three callees
 * ARE ALREADY DECOMPILED, so the rewrite calls them directly and dissolving those transfers
 * belongs to this caller's unit.
 *
 * ★ THE LIVE-OUT IS MEMORY, AND THAT IS DERIVED FROM THE ORACLE'S ONE CALL SITE. The frozen
 *   caller clears the accumulator on the instruction after this returns and loads every pointer
 *   it goes on to use from a literal, so nothing this routine leaves in a register is read. That
 *   is why the ceiling below is as wide as it is: the frozen block copy leaves its two pointers
 *   and its counter behind, and none of them is consumed.
 *
 * ★ THE TWO SESSIONS ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE, and only measurement says so. The driven tape
 *   reaches this routine 2765 times with the pending list EMPTY every single time, so on that
 *   tape the routine's whole body is the empty path and twelve of the thirteen twins below are
 *   invisible. Attract is what presents a loaded list, fifteen distinct fill levels of it. The
 *   per-session catch counts record that asymmetry rather than averaging it away.
 *
 * ★ A COUNT OF ZERO IS NOT A COUNT OF NOTHING. The count is used as a block-copy length, and a
 *   length of zero copies the whole address space. That arm cannot be reached by nudging one cell
 *   — the painter runs first and would walk a list the nudge did not build — so the WRAPPED COUNT
 *   arm builds a consistent machine for it: a full page of entries whose cells all carry the
 *   priority bit, which the eraser and the painter both pass over, leaving the copy as the only
 *   thing that runs. Both sides then walk out of memory and raise in the same place, which is
 *   what that arm asserts, and it is the only thing that separates the zero-is-empty twin from
 *   the rewrite.
 *
 * GATE: strict unit-capture with one measured exclusion, two replayed sessions, fifteen real
 *   entries and eight crafted ones. What it exercises, holes stated:
 *
 *   1. CONTRACT     — at the first real dispatch, identical outside the measured window.
 *   2. WINDOW       — the oracle's own deepest push, measured over the whole sweep and PINNED.
 *   3. BOUNDARY     — the exclusion is exactly as wide as it declares.
 *   4. FILL REACH   — measured: which fill levels each session presents, and that one of them
 *                     presents exactly one.
 *   5. CORPUS       — every dispatch of both sessions replays identically, counts pinned.
 *   6. BLIND        — on an empty list the oracle's writes are idempotent, so a no-op passes
 *                     there; the same measurement catches it on a loaded list.
 *   7. CRAFTED      — every crafted arm identical outside the measured window.
 *   8. WRAPPED COUNT— the zero-length copy, on a consistent machine, with the oracle's own raise
 *                     as the control that the arm reaches the copy at all.
 *   9. EXCLUDED     — no register outside the declared CEILING moves, with a twin that keeps a
 *                     record pointer as the in-arm control that the measurement can see one.
 *  10. CALLS, NOT DISPATCHES — the module's text: it must import and call all three callees
 *                     rather than reach them through the registry, with the oracle as control.
 *  11. TEETH        — thirteen broken twins, each with the number of arms that catches it and its
 *                     catch count in each real session, zeros kept.
 *
 * HOLE: no session presents a fill level above 60 bytes, so the crafted arms above that are the
 * only evidence for a full list, and the wrap arm is the only evidence for a zero count.
 * HOLE: the eraser, the painter and the empty-both step are gated by their own files. What this
 * file gates is the order they run in, the empty test, and the copy.
 *
 * WHERE THE STACK POINTER IS OWNED. sp sits inside the excluded ceiling here, so a rewrite that
 * leaked stack without writing memory would pass. assembled-swap.test.js owns that; this gate
 * does not, and says so rather than implying a coverage it does not have.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-5286.test.js
