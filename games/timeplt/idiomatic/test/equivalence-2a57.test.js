/**
 * spriteForHeading — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x2A57.
 *
 * GATE: crafted-entry live-out over the whole input space, every dispatch of a driven session,
 *   and a whole-session substitution with the rewrite actually wired in. The standard
 *   unitEquivalence verdict is worse than weak here, and this file measures that rather than
 *   asserting around it.
 *
 * ★ THE HOLES, STATED FIRST.
 *   1. `r.ram === null` is FALSE for the correct rewrite. The oracle brackets its inner call
 *      with a stack push, so it leaves a return address in the two bytes below the entry stack
 *      pointer; the rewrite models no stack and leaves them alone. Those two bytes are the
 *      WHOLE RAM difference, in both directions — the BLIND arm shows an empty body produce the
 *      identical RAM verdict. RAM decides nothing about this routine.
 *   2. The routine writes no memory at all, so the comparison every arm is judged by is RAM
 *      outside those two scratch bytes AND the register pair the callers consume.
 *   3. The FIRST dispatch the tape reaches is blind to HALF the twins below. It arrives on the
 *      captured record, on a heading where rounding to the nearest sector and truncating to it
 *      agree and where the circle does not wrap, while the counter is in the far half of the
 *      animation. unitEquivalence clones the first entry, not the first informative one, so no
 *      frame budget fixes that; the DEGENERATE arm names the four survivors and pins them.
 *   4. The routine reads its object through a caller-supplied record pointer, so a single
 *      captured dispatch pins ONE slot. The fixed-slot twin is the discriminating case: it
 *      survives the captured slot and dies on the other four the session presents.
 *
 * WHY THE LIVE-OUT IS {b, c}, DERIVED FROM THE CALLERS. refreshSpriteFromHeading stores the
 * second register into the object's sprite-entry control byte and the first into its tile code;
 * refreshSecondEraSpriteFromHeading stores the same two, each stepped by a constant, into the same two cells. Nothing else
 * the oracle leaves behind survives: both callers overwrite the accumulator on their next step,
 * neither branches on a flag, and their own callers loc_2927 and loc_294c either return at once
 * or go on to loc_4243, which loads the accumulator and both address pairs before reading any of
 * them. That is an argument, so the SUBSTITUTION arm is the falsifiable version — it wires the
 * rewrite, which never touches those registers, into a whole driven session.
 *
 * What it exercises, holes stated:
 *   1. CONTRACT — unitEquivalence at the real dispatch, with the scratch window excluded.
 *   2. BLIND — the RAM verdict shown to be identical for the rewrite and for an empty body.
 *   3. EXCLUDED — the divergence bounded by {a, f, d, e, h, l, sp} plus pc, and the RAM
 *      difference pinned to the scratch window, so "excluded" cannot quietly widen. A rewrite
 *      that clobbers fewer of those registers is an improvement and stays green.
 *   4. DEGENERATE — the four twins the captured entry cannot see, each named and each shown to
 *      be caught elsewhere.
 *   5. SESSION — every dispatch of a whole driven session compared on a real machine, the run
 *      asserted complete rather than merely finished.
 *   6. WINDOW — the excluded scratch measured at every one of those dispatches against THAT
 *      dispatch's own stack pointer. HOLE: every dispatch arrives at one depth, so the window
 *      has one sample; it is measured rather than assumed, but it is not measured deep.
 *   7. EXHAUSTIVE — every record the session presents, every heading of the circle, and four
 *      counter values covering both animation halves and both of the neighbouring bits.
 *   8. COUNTER — all 256 counter values, to show the animation half is decided by exactly one
 *      bit of it rather than by the low bits generally.
 *   9. ANTIPODE — the fixed-slot twin's predicate re-derived from the table data, so a gate
 *      agreeing with a wrong theory of why that twin fails would break here instead of passing.
 *  10. SUBSTITUTION — the rewrite wired into a driven session behind a shim that pays the
 *      T-states and the return the cycle-driven host still expects. Only the two scratch bytes
 *      ever differ, and they heal well before the end.
 *  11. TEETH — eight twins, each caught on exactly the inputs a stated predicate names, each
 *      caught on real traffic, and each shown to fork the substituted session.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-2a57.test.js
