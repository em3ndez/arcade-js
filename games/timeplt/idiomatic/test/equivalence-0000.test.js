/**
 * trampolineToSeatTheStackAndSettleTheControlLatch — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x0000.
 *
 * Three bytes, `jp 0x07B1`, at the address the processor starts from after a reset. It is the one
 * entry in this batch whose whole content is WHERE IT GOES.
 *
 * ★ THE REWRITE IMPORTS ITS DESTINATION INSTEAD OF DISPATCHING IT, which is the house rule for a
 *   callee that has been decompiled — and it has a consequence this gate has to work around: a
 *   recorder wired into the routine map catches the FROZEN path's transfer and cannot catch the
 *   rewrite's, because the rewrite never asks the map. So the two are compared at the NEXT seam
 *   both of them do reach, the jump out of the power-on routine at 0x0069, and this gate is
 *   therefore a gate on the PAIR. Two arms narrow that back down: CONTRIBUTION shows the frozen
 *   entry adds nothing of its own, and DESTINATION shows the rewrite really goes through the
 *   power-on routine, by the marks only that routine leaves.
 *
 * ★ IT IS A TRANSFER, NOT A CALL. The chain's last act is `m.call(0x0069)`, which runs 0x0069
 *   INCLUDING its `ret`, so the rewrite performs the caller's return itself and is wired RAW in
 *   the whole-machine arm, as _harness.js sets out.
 *
 * ★ THE STATE DUMP CANNOT SEE MOST OF WHAT THE PAIR DOES: past this entry, every write is to a
 *   device. So every comparison here reads the control latch, the watchdog count and the
 *   unmapped-access counters alongside the dump, and the DESTINATION arm's control twin is what
 *   shows that reading catching something.
 *
 * What it exercises, holes stated:
 *   1. REACH — dispatch counts under both tapes, with the destination as the positive control.
 *   2. CONTRIBUTION — the frozen entry, stopped AT its jump: nothing written, no register moved,
 *      one transfer, and it goes to 0x07B1. With a scribbling twin as the in-arm control.
 *   3. DESTINATION — the rewrite leaves the three marks only the power-on routine leaves, with a
 *      twin that goes straight to the continuation as the control that they are marks at all.
 *   4. SEAM — the captured entry and four crafted register files, both sides stopped at 0x0069.
 *   5. SOCKET — all 256 answers the expansion socket could give, carried through this entry.
 *   6. SETTING — the image byte the picture line follows, over all 256 values.
 *   7. TIME — this entry's own T-states and the pair's, measured separately at the two seams.
 *   8. WHOLE-MACHINE — both tapes, the full frame budget, byte-identical with the rewrite wired.
 *   9. EXCLUDED — measured, with a control twin.
 *  10. TEETH — six twins with their catch counts.
 *
 * HOLE: arms 4 to 6 cannot attribute a failure to this entry rather than to the power-on routine.
 * That is what the pairing costs, and the power-on routine has a gate of its own.
 * HOLE: pc and the cycle count are not compared, the ordinary memory-equivalence drop.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-0000.test.js
