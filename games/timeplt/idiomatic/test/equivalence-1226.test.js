/**
 * handPlayOverToOtherPlayer — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x1226.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. Three stores and no reads worth the name: a one-bit selector is toggled in place, a
 * countdown cell is re-armed with a fixed span, and the inner sequence index is loaded from a byte
 * of the program image rather than from an immediate. Nothing is returned and nothing is compared.
 *
 * ★ NO TAPE IN THIS CORPUS DISPATCHES THIS ENTRY, and the first arm asserts it. Its one caller IS
 *   reached — once per driven session — but that caller transfers here only when the cell it
 *   selects is non-zero, and on every tape that cell is zero. That is a fact about the corpus and
 *   NOT about the game: no tape here presses the two-player start button, and the cell the caller
 *   selects is the OTHER player's, which a one-player start leaves at zero for the whole game. So the corpus is MADE: the selected cell is armed to one
 *   at the caller's own dispatch, identically on both sides of every comparison, and the caller
 *   then transfers here for real, on a real machine, from its real call site. That is a crafted
 *   entry in the strict sense — a real state with one surgical nudge — not a fabricated one.
 *
 * GATE: armed real dispatches plus an exhaustive crafted sweep of the entry's whole input space,
 *   with a whole-machine replay. What it exercises, holes stated:
 *
 *   1. NEVER DISPATCHED — three tapes, zero dispatches each; the caller's own counts asserted too.
 *   2. ARMED CORPUS — with the cell armed the entry really is dispatched, and every dispatch
 *      replays identically. The attract tape never reaches the caller, so it contributes NOTHING
 *      and the arm asserts that zero rather than letting it read as coverage.
 *   3. EQUAL at the armed dispatch with NOTHING MASKED. This entry pushes nothing, so there is no
 *      dead stack window to exclude and the comparison is over the whole dumped state.
 *   4. NOT VACUOUS — a candidate that does nothing FAILS the same comparison.
 *   5. EXCLUDED, DELIBERATELY — the union of every register that differs anywhere in the crafted
 *      space, asserted as a set.
 *   6. THE FETCHED BYTE — the index is not an immediate, so the arm reads it through the machine's
 *      own memory map and asserts both what it is and that it comes from below the RAM window.
 *   7. EXHAUSTIVE — all 256 selector values against three entry accumulators. The selector is the
 *      only cell this entry reads, so 256 values IS its whole input space; the accumulators are
 *      there because the armed dispatch happens to arrive holding the value the oracle leaves.
 *   8. WHOLE-MACHINE — the two sessions that reach the caller, the rewrite wired through the
 *      omitted-return seam, compared frame by frame for their whole length.
 *   9. TEETH/seam — the same wiring with the seam removed, which must die.
 *  10. TEETH — eight twins, each with an exact crafted count, an exact per-tape armed count, and a
 *      recorded whole-machine verdict.
 *
 * HOLE: one armed dispatch per session, and the same one in both sessions — same selector, same
 * accumulator, same stack pointer. The real corpus therefore discriminates almost nothing on its
 * own; the exhaustive sweep is the load-bearing arm and the per-twin counts say so, two of the
 * eight twins being invisible to every armed dispatch and to the whole-machine arm alike.
 * HOLE: the corpus exists only because a cell was armed. Nothing here shows that the game ever
 * arms that cell itself, so this file says what the entry DOES and not when the game runs it.
 * HOLE: the whole-machine arm runs the attract tape not at all, because the caller is never
 * reached there and wiring the rewrite over an address nothing dispatches would pass vacuously.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-1226.test.js
