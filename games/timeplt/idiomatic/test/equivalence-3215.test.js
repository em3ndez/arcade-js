/**
 * startOnePlayerGame — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x3215.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. A handful of stores, one packed-decimal subtraction, and transfers into routines
 * that are ALREADY DECOMPILED — the caption park at 0x0B2B, the panel repaint at 0x4AFB, the
 * tilemap keep copy at 0x4B30 and the sequence jump at 0x172A — so the rewrite calls each of them
 * directly and dissolving those transfers belongs to this caller's unit.
 *
 * ★ THE ORACLE PUSHES AND RETURNS, AND THE REWRITE DOES NEITHER. The transfers reached by `call`
 *   are each bracketed with a pushed return address below the entry seat, and the tail jump's
 *   callee takes a return the direct call never takes. That
 *   leaves DEAD STACK SCRATCH below the seat and moves several registers, the stack pointer and
 *   pc. The window is MEASURED — the WINDOW arm instruments the oracle's own `push16` over this
 *   file's whole sweep and reports the deepest stack pointer it reaches — never assumed and never
 *   copied from another gate. Every other arm walks the whole dump and masks ONLY that window.
 *
 * WHY THE LIVE-OUT IS MEMORY ONLY, derived from the ORACLE's exit successors and not from the
 *   module: the oracle's last act is a tail jump to 0x172A, whose `ret` lands on 0x181D — which is
 *   a bare `ret` — so no register this entry leaves is read before it is overwritten. Confirmed by
 *   running the tape: the oracle's pc after the captured dispatch is 0x181D.
 *
 * GATE: strict unit-capture at the real dispatch with one measured exclusion, plus a POISONED
 *   machine, because the strict arm alone would rest on the wrong evidence. At the captured
 *   dispatch most of the cells this entry stores to already hold what it stores, so a broken twin
 *   could only show up in stack scratch — which is exactly what is masked. Filling work RAM below
 *   the window and both tilemap planes with a marker first makes every write visible, and loading
 *   the two cells this entry READS with different values is what makes a twin reading the wrong
 *   one diverge at a stored cell.
 *
 *   1. EQUAL      — identical across the whole state dump outside the measured window, at the
 *                   real dispatch, over every dispatch the tape produces.
 *   2. WINDOW     — the oracle's own deepest push, measured over the whole sweep and PINNED, so a
 *                   change that deepens its stack traffic turns this gate red instead of being
 *                   absorbed by a wider mask.
 *   3. BOUNDARY   — the exclusion is exactly as wide as it declares: a planted divergence one byte
 *                   BELOW the window is caught, one AT the entry seat is caught, and one INSIDE is
 *                   masked. The last is what shows the first two are not the instrument catching
 *                   everything.
 *   4. STORES     — over the poisoned machine the oracle really writes every cell the twins below
 *                   are built to break, so their catches rest on writes rather than on scratch.
 *   5. EXCLUDED   — no register outside the declared CEILING moves, with a two-sided control: a
 *                   planted move OUTSIDE the ceiling is reported and one INSIDE is not.
 *   6. PRIORS     — every value of the packed-decimal count, crossed with a spread of the starting
 *                   count, since what is stored and painted depends on those two and on nothing
 *                   else this entry controls.
 *   7. CALLS, NOT RESTATES — the module's text: it must name each callee's file and call it rather
 *                   than carry that callee's body, with each callee's own body as a control.
 *   8. TEETH      — broken twins, each built the way the module is built, with a measured catch
 *                   count over the sweep. One of them is memory-equivalent by construction and is
 *                   caught on a REGISTER alone, which is the marshalling leak a memory gate cannot
 *                   see.
 *
 * HOLE: every callee is gated by its own file. What this file gates is the CHOICE of what
 * is stored and of the order relative to the repaint, and the dissolve of every transfer.
 * HOLE: this gate pins the candidate's pc but leaves sp inside the excluded set, so a rewrite that
 * leaked stack without writing memory would pass here. assembled-swap.test.js owns that.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-3215.test.js
