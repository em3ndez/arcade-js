/**
 * loc_3e6c — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x3E6C.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. An object flown one step along the velocity it carries and its slot retired once
 * that step lands it on a retire line, with one era of the game also restyling it first. All four
 * routines it reaches are already decompiled, so every transfer is dissolved into a direct call.
 *
 * ★ HOW THIS FILE HANDLES THE MISSING RETURN. The oracle nets exactly one return on both its
 *   exits — its own conditional one, or the transfer whose target returns for it — and the rewrite
 *   performs neither. That is the shape the dispatch seam exists for, so the candidate is run
 *   THROUGH the seam here, as an assembled run would reach it. The seam MEASURES what the rewrite
 *   did to the stack and throws if it is neither recognised shape, so wiring it in is an assertion,
 *   and it lets SP and pc be compared for EQUALITY on every entry below. Nothing in this file
 *   asserts that the candidate DIFFERS from the oracle anywhere.
 *
 * ★ THE RESTYLING ARM IS CRAFTED-ONLY AND THE CORPUS ARM PROVES IT. No session here ever presents
 *   the era that arm is gated on — the two the tapes reach are asserted as a set — so the arm is
 *   reached by poking that one cell on a real captured machine, identically on both sides.
 *
 * GATE: strict unit-capture over every dispatch of two real sessions, a crafted cross over the era
 *   byte, the two coordinates the line test reads and the counter the shape cycle runs off, and a
 *   whole-machine replay. What it exercises, holes stated:
 *
 *   1. CORPUS SHAPE — dispatch counts per session, and the eras real play presents, as a set.
 *   2. EQUAL at the real dispatch — RAM outside the dead stack window, SP and pc all identical.
 *   3. NOT VACUOUS — a do-nothing twin FAILS the same comparison at the real entry.
 *   4. SEAM — SP and pc agree on every crafted entry and every real dispatch, not just the first.
 *   5. EXCLUDED — the registers that move are reported and bounded by a CEILING, asserted as a
 *      subset rather than an equality so a rewrite agreeing MORE closely cannot fail. SP, pc and
 *      both index registers are asserted to be outside it.
 *   6. EXHAUSTIVE ERA — all 256 values of the one cell that chooses the restyling arm.
 *   7. CRAFTED CROSS — coordinates straddling both retire lines at the restyling era and at a
 *      plain one, and the free-running counter swept far enough to cover the whole shape cycle.
 *   8. ARMS — the cross is shown to reach the retire and the no-retire outcomes, and to write the
 *      shape only in the one era.
 *   9. CORPUS — every dispatch of both sessions replays identically.
 *  10. WHOLE-MACHINE — a driven session with the rewrite wired through the seam, differing only in
 *      dead stack bytes, and the same instrument shown CATCHING a do-nothing twin.
 *  11. TEETH — eight twins, each with an exact crafted catch count.
 *
 * HOLE: one captured machine, and one slot. The era, the two coordinates and the shape counter are
 * varied; which slot the index registers point at is whatever the captured frame left, and the
 * caller that reaches this entry from outside the record walk is not exercised at all.
 * HOLE: the crafted cross reaches a retire by moving the coordinates, not by letting an object fly
 * to the line over many frames.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-3e6c.test.js
