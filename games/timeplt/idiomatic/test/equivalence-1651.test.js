 * dispatchSequencePhase1SubStepArm — equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x1651, under the
 * DISSOLVED-DISPATCH contract.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. Read the inner sequence sub-step and run the arm that index names out of the word table
 * that follows this entry, then run this mode's shared tail. The index is taken RAW; the doubling that
 * reaches a two-byte entry wraps at eight bits, so an index and that index plus 128 pick the same slot
 * — the low seven bits are what chooses. The rewrite no longer computes the arm's address and enters
 * it through the restart-vector dispatch; it switches on the low seven bits and calls the arm's
 * idiomatic module DIRECTLY for slots 0..12, then returns the shared tail. Each arm PLAIN-RETURNS —
 * it does not pop a return address, and its sub-calls are ordinary JS calls, not machine calls that
 * push and pop. So the two sides here NO LONGER share an exit stack pointer or an exit program
 * counter, and NEITHER is compared: with the dispatch dissolved, the dispatcher's return is supplied
 * at the seam in production (withOmittedRet), and the contract that remains is the WORK MEMORY the
 * arm, its sub-calls, AND the shared tail leave.
 *
 * ★ THE SHARED TAIL IS PART OF THE CONTRACT — this is where phase 1 differs from phase 2. Phase 2's
 *   tail does nothing; phase 1's tail `advanceSequenceElseStartFreePlayGame` DOES work (it advances
 *   the sequence / may start a free-play game). The oracle runs arm THEN tail, and so does the
 *   rewrite, so whatever the tail writes to memory is compared here exactly as the oracle produces it
 *   — it is NOT masked. The skips-the-tail twin below proves this is load-bearing: dropping the tail
 *   is caught on the DRIVEN corpus, where the tail really does write live memory (0xa9ab/0xa9ac).
 *
 * ★ THE ONE PLACE THE TWO SIDES DIVERGE is a dead band of stack scratch, the SCRATCH_BYTES below the
 *   entry stack pointer, and it is MASKED. The oracle reaches the arm through a chain that brackets
 *   the lookup with pushes and pops of nested return addresses; the rewrite calls directly, so the
 *   two write different bytes below the stack pointer both sides leave — transient scratch, dead the
 *   moment the routine returns. The band is MEASURED (an exact ceiling asserted in CORPUS, so a change
 *   surfaces here rather than being absorbed). The SCRATCH test proves the mask is not blind:
 *   divergence really appears inside the band, and NOTHING escapes it. The TEETH prove the mask is not
 *   over-broad: a wrong arm — or a dropped tail — writes real work memory outside the band and is
 *   caught.
 *
 * GATE: strict unit-capture over the shared coin-then-start tape and the attract tape, a replayed
 *   corpus of every dispatch of both, a crafted sweep of the table's own slots (and their eight-bit
 *   wraps), and teeth. The memory comparison masks only the dead scratch band above.
 *
 * HOLE: what each arm DOES is not exercised here beyond the indices the two sessions present; crafted
 * slots are asserted only to select the SAME arm the oracle's table selects (same masked memory, or
 * the SAME fault), never to be correct.
 * HOLE: the index is taken RAW, so the crafted sweep is scoped to the table's own thirteen slots
 * (0..12) and the same slots reached through the eight-bit wrap (128..140). Indices between those two
 * runs select bytes further down the image that are NOT part of this table; the rewrite raises
 * NotImplemented for them, and while the oracle raises the same fault for most, a handful of those
 * garbage indices (low seven bits 52, 55, 58, 110, 112, 120) address bytes that happen to enter
 * mapped code and DO NOT fault. What the oracle does at those raw indices is outside this entry's
 * contract — the corpus never presents any index past 12 — and is not asserted here. (Flagged to the
 * confirmer/LEAD: this is a property of the raw index reaching non-table bytes, not of the arms.)
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-1651.test.js
