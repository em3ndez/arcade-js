 * markObjectsTouchingPlayer — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x51B3.
 *
 * GATE: a large real corpus from two tapes, plus crafted entries that force the arms real play
 *   does not present. What it exercises, holes stated:
 *
 *   1. CORPUS — a bounded sample of every dispatch of both tapes, each a whole-state-dump
 *      comparison; the total dispatch count is asserted, so a shrinking corpus fails loudly.
 *   2. NO EXCLUSION WINDOW AT ALL — this routine pushes nothing, so the two arms agree on every
 *      byte of the dump including the stack. Asserted rather than assumed.
 *   3. REGISTERS AND PC ARE EXCLUDED, DELIBERATELY, and pinned to at most {a, f, sp}. Both
 *      cursors and the count are reproduced and compared, not excused.
 *   4. WHAT THE CORPUS COVERS, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT — measured: how many real dispatches pass the
 *      guard, how many find an object in play, and how many actually mark one. If real play never
 *      marks anything, the crafted arms are the only thing gating the mark, and this says so.
 *   5. THE MARK LANDS — crafted so an object sits exactly on the reference: one state byte moves,
 *      to the value this file names, and no other cell does. Measured off the ORACLE.
 *   6. THE BOX IS TWO-SIDED AND WRAPPED — the object walked along one axis through the whole 256
 *      values, twice (once per axis), with the set of positions that mark recorded as a run. That
 *      is what shows the test is a wrapped window and not a comparison.
 *   7. BOTH AXES ARE REQUIRED — an object inside the box on one axis and outside on the other is
 *      not marked, asserted for each axis separately.
 *   8. THE COUNT OF ZERO WALKS 256 SLOTS — asserted against a count of one, so the loop's shape
 *      is pinned at the value a naive rewrite gets wrong.
 *   9. TEETH — nine twins, each reported with its catch count over the crafted cross.
 *
 * HOLE: what a marked object goes on to do is not covered here, nor what the guard byte or the
 * reference position belong to. The crafted arms use a run of one slot except where stated, so
 * the multi-slot walk is covered by the real corpus and by arm 8 rather than exhaustively.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-51b3.test.js
