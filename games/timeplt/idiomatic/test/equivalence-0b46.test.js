 * loc_0b46 — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x0B46.
 *
 * GATE: strict unit-capture with ONE exclusion, a replayed corpus from three tapes, an exhaustive
 *   crafted sweep of the ring priors, a whole-run masked diff, and teeth. What it exercises, with
 *   the holes stated:
 *
 *   1. EQUAL at the real dispatch — RAM identical, and the command pair the rewrite leaves behind
 *      identical too. AT THE CAPTURED ENTRY THE EXCLUSION OF 2 BUYS NOTHING: the pushed bytes
 *      happen to equal what was already below the stack pointer, so the raw comparison is
 *      identical as well, and the test asserts that rather than the coincidence of a dirty window.
 *   2. THE DEAD STACK SCRATCH IS THE ONE EXCLUSION, and it is load-bearing over a session rather
 *      than at that one dispatch. The oracle's callee brackets its work with a push/pop of the
 *      address pair, so the two popped bytes below the stack pointer can hold that pair; the
 *      rewrite models no stack. The window is exactly [SP-2, SP) and every arm PINS it — each
 *      walks the whole dump and asserts no divergence escapes it, so it cannot quietly widen.
 *   3. REGISTERS AND PC ARE EXCLUDED, DELIBERATELY, and pinned to exactly {a, f, sp}. The command
 *      pair is NOT in that set: it is a live-out, see 7.
 *   4. UNIFORM CORPUS, AND THIS ONE REALLY IS UNIFORM. Every dispatch of all three tapes presents
 *      a FREE ring cell, one guard byte, and seventeen even cursors that never reach the last
 *      slot. So the DROP branch and the ring WRAP never happen on real data at this entry, and
 *      the test asserts those sets rather than merely reporting them.
 *   5. CORPUS — every dispatch of three sessions replayed, not a deduplicated sample.
 *   6. EXHAUSTIVE — all 256 cursors against four guard bytes, which is the only arm that reaches
 *      the drop branch, the ring wrap and the eight-bit wrap of the argument cell.
 *   7. THE COMMAND PAIR IS A LIVE-OUT, and that is MEASURED rather than argued. Two whole driven
 *      sessions are diffed frame by frame: with the pair written back, the only cells that ever
 *      differ are the two scratch bytes of 2; with the pair dropped, two further cells appear.
 *      That is why the rewrite writes the pair into the registers as well as passing it.
 *   8. WHOLE-MACHINE — the same masked diff over all three tapes, the rewrite wired through a shim.
 *      The shim pays the oracle's T-states and takes its return, because the host engine is
 *      cycle-driven and every path in arrives by a tail transfer; without it the stack creeps
 *      until an unrelated routine writes through a corrupted address. Test 9 checks the shim's
 *      total against the oracle over the crafted space instead of assuming it, and one twin below
 *      is the shim removed, which dies exactly that way.
 *   9. The shim's branch-dependent total, checked against the oracle.
 *  10. TEETH — eight twins at eight distinct behaviours, each declaring the EXACT arms that catch
 *      it. Two are invisible to every real dispatch and are caught only by the crafted sweep.
 *
 * HOLE: the corpus presents ONE guard byte and seventeen cursors, identically on all three tapes,
 * so the real data discriminates almost nothing here — the crafted sweep is the load-bearing arm
 * and the per-twin catch counts say so explicitly.
 * HOLE: no tape drives this entry into a state where the ring is congested, so "the drop is
 * silent" is exercised only by crafted priors.
 * HOLE: every dispatch any of the three tapes produces sits in the FIRST era, which the corpus arm
 * asserts. This entry reads no era cell, so what it does cannot depend on one — but nothing here
 * speaks for the states a later era dispatches it in, because none was reached.
 * HOLE: THE WHOLE-RUN ARM IS PARTLY BLIND TO THE PAIR'S VALUE. Two twins that queue a different
 * pair leave the session identical outside the scratch window, so it is the unit arms, not the
 * whole-run one, that hold this entry to the pair it chooses. The per-twin verdicts are measured
 * and asserted individually rather than summarised, so a twin that changes side fails loudly.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-0b46.test.js
