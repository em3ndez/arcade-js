/**
 * paintHighScoreReadout — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x0D6B.
 *
 * Three constants and a fall-through into the six-digit readout printer at ROM 0x0D73 (already
 * decompiled): the tally to print (from its highest byte, because the printer walks downward), the
 * cell its leftmost digit lands in, and the digit colour. The rewrite calls paintSixDigitFieldSuppressingLeadingZeros directly;
 * dissolving that transfer is this caller's unit, and the printer is gated by its own file, so what
 * this file gates is the CHOICE of the three arguments and the dissolve.
 *
 * The oracle reaches the printer through `m.call`, so the printer's body pushes return addresses
 * below the entry seat and takes a return the direct call never takes — leaving DEAD STACK SCRATCH
 * below the seat and moving a, f, sp and pc (the declared ceiling). The window is MEASURED, not
 * assumed: the WINDOW arm instruments the oracle's own `push16` at the captured entry and every
 * dispatch and reports the deepest stack pointer reached. Every other arm walks the whole dump and
 * masks ONLY that window.
 *
 * Strict unit-capture at the real dispatch with the printer RUNNING, plus the argument triple
 * PINNED as values, plus a corpus and teeth. The PINNED arm records the triple off the ORACLE by
 * replacing the printer in the routine registry, and requires the module's own text to name the
 * same three constants (a sibling entry's text is the control).
 *   ★ HOLE: the registry recorder reaches the ORACLE only. The rewrite's transfer is a direct call
 *   no registry entry can intercept, so the candidate side of the argument comparison is carried by
 *   the masked whole-RAM diff at the real dispatch and over the corpus — the printer runs for real
 *   on both arms and every cell it touches is compared — and by the twins.
 *
 * HOLE: one dispatch per session, at one point in the sequence, so nothing exercises the printer
 * against a different screen state. HOLE: nothing here establishes what the tally being printed IS.
 * This gate pins pc but leaves sp in the excluded set, so a rewrite that leaked stack without
 * writing memory passes here — assembled-swap.test.js owns that.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-0d6b.test.js
