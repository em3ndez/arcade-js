 * stepSevenCraftSlots — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x28A1.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. Seven calls in a row, each to a sibling entry that seats one object record and one
 * sprite entry and then runs the era-keyed handler over them. ALL SEVEN SIBLINGS ARE ALREADY
 * DECOMPILED, so the rewrite calls them directly and dissolving those seven transfers belongs to
 * this caller's unit. What is left over is the ORDER, and one resume point per call.
 *
 * ★ WHY THIS FILE IS BUILT AROUND AN ORDER ARM, AND IT IS NOT A PRECAUTION. Each sibling works a
 *   DIFFERENT record and a DIFFERENT sprite entry, so the seven writes do not overlap and the
 *   memory comparison cannot see what order they happened in. Measured, not assumed: the SWAP and
 *   REVERSED twins below are caught on ZERO of the crafted entries and ZERO of the real dispatches
 *   by the masked RAM/SP/pc comparison, and on thousands by the ORDER arm. A gate for this routine
 *   that only diffed memory would be green on a rewrite that ran the chain backwards.
 *
 * ★ HOW THE LIVE-OUT WAS DERIVED, AND IT IS FROM THE ORACLE. The oracle's only exit is its own
 *   return, reached after the seventh call; every call is bracketed by a push the callee's chain
 *   consumes, so nothing is left on the stack and the seat is restored. The oracle therefore hands
 *   its caller memory and whatever the seventh sibling's handler left in registers — this entry
 *   computes nothing of its own. Which registers those are is MEASURED by the EXCLUDED arm rather
 *   than declared, and bounded by a ceiling.
 *
 * ★ NOTHING IS LAID ON THE STACK. Each sibling, and the era-keyed handler it runs, is a direct
 *   call that leaves the stack where it found it, so the rewrite lays no resume point down for any
 *   of them. The two stack twins are the old shapes: PARKS-LIKE-THE-ROM lays one down wherever the
 *   frozen chain does, and PARKS-ALWAYS lays one down for every link; nothing lifts either, and
 *   both are caught.
 *
 * ★ SP AND pc BELONG TO THE DISPATCH SEAM. The oracle nets one return; the rewrite performs none.
 *   The candidate is run THROUGH `withOmittedRet` here, as an assembled run reaches it, and SP and
 *   pc are then compared for EQUALITY. Nothing in this file asserts the candidate DIFFERS anywhere.
 *
 * GATE: strict unit-capture over every dispatch of two real sessions, a crafted cross over the
 *   mother-ship gate byte and all 256 era values, an order trace, and a whole-machine replay.
 *
 *   1. REACH — dispatch counts, and the eras and gate bytes the sessions present, all measured,
 *      with a positive control that the collectors can read values the sessions do not present.
 *   2. EQUAL — at the first dispatch of each session: masked RAM, SP and pc identical.
 *   3. NOT VACUOUS — a candidate that does nothing FAILS that same comparison.
 *   4. SCRATCH — the masked window is the ORACLE'S OWN deepest push, instrumented over this file's
 *      whole sweep and PINNED; every raw difference lies strictly below the entry pointer and no
 *      deeper than that; and at least one is seen, so the mask is not decoration.
 *   5. CORPUS — every dispatch of both sessions replays identically.
 *   6. CROSS — two captured bases crossed with four gate-byte values and all 256 eras; the eras
 *      whose handler word this port has not transcribed are required to fault IDENTICALLY on both
 *      sides rather than to be correct.
 *   7. ORDER — the sequence of cursor pairs the handler works, taken from BOTH sides by the same
 *      REGISTER-FREE instrument (the selector read, then the first read inside a seated record),
 *      compared as an ordered list, with a permuted twin as the control that the instrument can
 *      report a difference.
 *   7a. FAIRNESS — on the oracle, which still seats the pair, that instrument agrees EXACTLY with
 *      the register probe this file used before, on every crafted entry of arms 0-4 and every real
 *      dispatch; on arm 7 the pair is shown not to be an input (cursors complemented into it:
 *      silent; the same poison into the era-0 handler: heard); arms 5-6 fault alike.
 *   8. EXCLUDED — the registers that move, bounded by a CEILING asserted as a subset so a rewrite
 *      that agrees MORE closely cannot fail, plus a positive control on a register outside it.
 *   8a. LIVE — against the chain the live game ran before this rewrite (resume points parked, the
 *      cursors seated, the handler reached through the call seam into the lifted handlers), every
 *      register but the two seated cursors is identical: the rest of the ceiling is the frozen
 *      handlers' scratch, not this rewrite's.
 *   8b. DEAD AT EXIT — every register in that ceiling, the two cursors included, poisoned on the
 *      frozen game at every exit of each whole session, changes nothing, beside a control the same
 *      instrument does hear.
 *   9. WHOLE-MACHINE — a wired session of each tape through a shim that also restores the oracle's
 *      T-state cost, differing only in dead stack bytes; and the same instrument shown catching a
 *      do-nothing twin.
 *  10. TEETH — eight twins, each with an exact crafted and real catch count under BOTH the masked
 *      comparison and the order comparison, so a twin one of them is blind to is recorded as such.
 *
 * WHY THE WHOLE-MACHINE SHIM RESTORES T-STATES. No idiomatic module spends any, and the engine this
 * arm drives is cycle-driven, so a rewrite moves the frame phase. That is a property nothing here
 * owns; the shim measures the oracle's own cost on a clone and gives it back, so the arm reports on
 * memory rather than on phase. The TEETH arm beside it shows the arm still fails a broken twin.
 *
 * HOLE: both sessions present ONE era each and gate byte 0 only, so five of the eight handler arms
 * and the whole stand-down path are reached only by the crafted cross.
 * HOLE: two of the eight handler words address nothing this port has transcribed. For those the
 * cross can say no more than that both sides fault the same way.
 * HOLE: the order instrument watches entries into the handler ARMS. A rewrite that reordered work
 * INSIDE one arm is out of its view; that belongs to the arms' own gates.
 * HOLE: the order instrument names a pair only when the handler reads its record. Arms 5-6 fault
 * first and arm 7 takes no pair, so on those arms (crafted only) it reports nothing on either side;
 * how many times arm 7 runs is left to the masked comparison.
 *
