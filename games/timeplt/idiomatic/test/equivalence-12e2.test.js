/**
 * loc_12e2 — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x12E2.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. Three instructions: point at the sequence delay, decrement it in place, and return
 * unless it has just reached zero. When it has, control falls through into ROM 0x12E7, WHICH IS
 * ALREADY DECOMPILED, so the rewrite calls loc_12e7 directly and dissolving that fall-through
 * belongs to this caller's unit. The decrement wraps rather than sticking, so the cell held at
 * zero buys a full 256 frames before the next decision.
 *
 * ★ NO EXCLUSION, AND THAT IS MEASURED RATHER THAN ASSUMED. The frozen routine reaches its tail by
 *   falling through rather than by calling, and the WINDOW arm instruments the oracle's own push
 *   over the whole crafted space and finds it never goes below its seat. So the whole state dump
 *   is compared, the stack included, and there is no masked window anywhere in this file.
 *
 * ★ THE LIVE-OUT IS DERIVED FROM THE ORACLE'S EXIT SUCCESSORS, NOT FROM THE REWRITE. The oracle
 *   has two exits and neither leaves a consumer. One is its own `ret nz`. The other is the tail,
 *   which ends in ROM 0x1226 or ROM 0x0F1A, each a plain `ret` — so both arms hand back to
 *   whatever called THIS entry. Nothing calls it: the little-endian word for this address occurs
 *   in the whole 24KB image exactly once, at ROM 0x0F3F, which is arm 11 of the inline jump table
 *   that the sequence dispatcher at ROM 0x0F1F reads, and that dispatcher parks its own return
 *   address before transferring. Arms of that table leave wholly different register files from one
 *   another, so nothing downstream can be reading one. Hence memory-only — and the LIVE-OUT arm
 *   below does not stop at the reading: it forces EVERY register except the stack pointer hostile
 *   after every dispatch of a whole session and finds the machine bit-identical, with a poke at
 *   the one cell this routine writes as the positive control that the instrument can see anything
 *   at all.
 *
 * ★ THE FIRING ARM IS RARE AND THE HAND-OVER ARM IS NEVER REACHED. Real play spends almost every
 *   dispatch counting down; the delay reaches zero a handful of times per session, and on none of
 *   those does the other player have a life left, so the tail's hand-over branch is not exercised
 *   by any session here. Both facts are measured and asserted, and the two twins that only differ
 *   on the hand-over branch are recorded as caught by ZERO real dispatches and by no whole run
 *   either. The crafted cross is what holds them.
 *
 * GATE: strict unit-capture with NO exclusion, six replayed real sessions at every dispatch, a
 *   sweep that is exhaustive over this routine's own decision, and a whole-machine replay. What it
 *   exercises, holes stated:
 *
 *   1. CONTRACT — unitEquivalence at the first real dispatch: the whole dump is identical.
 *   2. NOT VACUOUS — a no-op FAILS the same diff, at a real cell, so the arm above decides
 *      something.
 *   3. WINDOW — the oracle's own pushes, measured over the whole crafted space and PINNED at
 *      nothing, which is what licenses comparing the stack.
 *   4. WRITE-SET — every address the frozen routine moves, measured across both arms and both
 *      branches of the tail.
 *   5. TAPE REACH — measured, with the A/B that makes each zero mean something.
 *   6. ARM REACH — how many dispatches actually fire, and how many of those hand the turn over.
 *      The zero is controlled by the crafted space reaching that branch 48 times.
 *   7. CORPUS — every dispatch of every session, not a deduplicated sample.
 *   8. EXCLUDED — a CEILING over the crafted space: no register outside the declared set moves,
 *      with an in-arm control showing the measurement can see one that does.
 *   9. EXHAUSTIVE — all 256 values of the delay cell, which is this routine's whole own input, plus
 *      a cross over the tail's three inputs at three delays.
 *  10. LIVE-OUT — the hostile-register instrument, with its positive control.
 *  11. DISSOLVES, NOT RESTATES — the module's text: it must name the tail's file and call it rather
 *      than carry the tail's own body, with an inlined variant as the positive control.
 *  12. WHOLE-MACHINE — a stepped session with the rewrite wired, diffed every frame.
 *  13. TEETH — ten twins, each with its exact crafted catch count, its exact per-session count and
 *      its whole-machine verdict; the two the real corpus cannot see say so.
 *
 * The whole-machine replay needs a shim: the host engine is cycle-driven and both arms end in a
 * return the rewrite does not take, so a candidate charging no T-states would move the vblank
 * interrupt and leak two stack bytes per dispatch. The total is measured off a clone per dispatch
 * rather than predicted, which makes it exact by construction.
 *
 * HOLE: every session here reaches this entry only because one nibble is forced at the sequence
 * dispatcher. Nothing in this file says how often an untouched cabinet takes arm 11.
 * HOLE: the crafted cross varies the active-player index and the two saved life counts and nothing
 * else about the tail's world; what the tail then does with them is its own gate's business.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-12e2.test.js
