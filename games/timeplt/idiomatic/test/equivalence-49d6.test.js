/**
 * loc_49d6 — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x49D6.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. A pulse train driven one step per call: a pending count, a phase counter, and one
 * hardware output line raised at the start of a phase and dropped at its midpoint.
 *
 * ★ RAM IS NOT THE WHOLE GATE HERE, AND THAT IS THE POINT. The line this entry drives is a latch
 *   bit, not a memory cell, so it does not appear in the state dump at all. A comparison that
 *   looked only at RAM would pass a candidate that never touches the line — measured, not argued:
 *   the LINE IS INVISIBLE arm below asserts exactly that a line-dropping twin survives the RAM
 *   diff and is caught only once the latch is compared. Every arm in this file therefore compares
 *   the latch as well as memory.
 *
 * ★ THE REAL CORPUS IS ENTIRELY THE IDLE ARM, AND EVERY ARM HERE SAYS SO. All 1765 dispatches of
 *   the shared session arrive with NOTHING PENDING, so the routine returns having done nothing —
 *   the CORPUS SHAPE arm asserts that count exactly. A real dispatch therefore cannot tell a
 *   correct rewrite from one that does nothing at all, and the REAL DISPATCH IS VACUOUS arm
 *   asserts that too rather than leaving it implied. The crafted sweep is the whole gate.
 *
 * GATE: an EXHAUSTIVE crafted sweep of everything this entry reads, a replayed real session that
 *   is measured and declared vacuous, and a whole-machine replay. What it exercises, holes stated:
 *
 *   1. EQUAL at the real dispatch — RAM and the whole latch identical, with nothing masked;
 *      neither side writes the stack. TRUE BUT VACUOUS, and arm 2 measures the vacuity.
 *   2. REAL DISPATCH IS VACUOUS, MEASURED — a no-op twin PASSES at the captured entry.
 *   3. NOT VACUOUS, CRAFTED — the same no-op twin FAILS on a crafted entry with work to do.
 *   4. EXCLUDED, DELIBERATELY — the union of every register that differs anywhere in the crafted
 *      sweep is exactly {a, f, l, sp}, so "excluded" is pinned over the whole space and not at one
 *      entry, where the arms it never reaches would leave the set artificially small.
 *   5. CORPUS — every dispatch replayed, with the count and the arm histogram asserted.
 *   6. EXHAUSTIVE — all 256 phase values, four pending counts, and BOTH starting states of the
 *      driven line, which is what makes a spurious drop visible: writing a zero over a zero
 *      changes nothing, so half of these twins are invisible unless the line starts high.
 *   7. WHOLE-MACHINE — the shared session with the rewrite wired through the omitted-return seam.
 *   8. TEETH — eight twins, each with exact catch counts. SEVEN of the eight are caught ZERO times
 *      by the real session, which is arm 2's finding stated per twin. The eighth removes the
 *      idle gate, and so is caught on every one of the 1765 real dispatches — that contrast is
 *      what shows the corpus is measuring the gate and only the gate.
 *
 * HOLE: the whole-machine arm compares memory, which cannot see the line either, and the session
 * it runs never leaves the idle arm. It is the crafted sweep alone that holds this entry to the
 * line it drives.
 * HOLE: nothing here says what the line is FOR. Its bit position is the only thing this file
 * knows about it, and a wrong belief about the device on the other end would not fail any arm.
 * HOLE: no tape reached a state with a pulse pending, so every non-idle arm of this routine is
 * exercised by crafted priors only.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-49d6.test.js
