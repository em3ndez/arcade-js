/**
 * pickScriptAtRandomOrInTurn — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x382D.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. A draw from the shared generator, one comparison against a threshold cell, and two
 * entirely different answers behind it: at or above the threshold the drawn byte is folded into a
 * four-wide band and handed back with nothing written; below it the drawn byte is discarded and a
 * five-long cycle counter is stepped, stored and handed back instead. The generator is ALREADY
 * DECOMPILED, so the rewrite calls it directly and dissolving that transfer belongs here.
 *
 * ★ THE LIVE-OUT IS A REGISTER, AND IT IS DERIVED FROM THE ORACLE'S CALL SITES, NOT FROM THE
 *   MODULE. Both frozen callers store the accumulator into the same slot of an object record the
 *   moment this returns — one of them adds nine first — so the accumulator is what this routine
 *   is FOR, and a gate comparing memory alone would be green on a rewrite that computed the wrong
 *   answer on the band arm, which writes nothing. The BLIND arm demonstrates precisely that with
 *   two twins, and every comparison below therefore checks the accumulator as well as memory.
 *
 * ★ THE ALTERNATE REGISTER SET IS IN THE CEILING BECAUSE THE FROZEN GENERATOR SWAPS THROUGH IT
 *   and the rewrite's generator does not. That is measured here, not assumed: the sweep carries
 *   an arm with those six registers scrambled to a marker, which is what makes them show up in
 *   the EXCLUDED reading at all rather than sitting at values the generator would have left
 *   anyway. Nothing between either caller's call site and its next write to those registers reads
 *   them, so no caller is coupled to the difference.
 *
 * GATE: strict unit-capture with one measured exclusion, two replayed sessions, twenty-three
 *   crafted arms. What it exercises, holes stated:
 *
 *   1. CONTRACT   — unitEquivalence at the first real dispatch: RAM identical.
 *   2. WINDOW     — the oracle's own deepest push, measured over the whole sweep and PINNED.
 *   3. BOUNDARY   — the exclusion is exactly as wide as it declares: one byte BELOW is caught,
 *                   one AT the entry seat is caught, one INSIDE is masked.
 *   4. ARM REACH  — measured: both answers are reached by both sessions, so neither arm below
 *                   rests on crafting alone.
 *   5. CORPUS     — every dispatch of both sessions replays identically, counts pinned.
 *   6. BLIND      — RAM alone passes two twins that return the wrong answer, and the same
 *                   measurement catches them once the accumulator is included.
 *   7. CRAFTED    — every arm identical outside the measured window.
 *   8. EXCLUDED   — no register outside the declared CEILING moves, with a twin that keeps a
 *                   pointer as the in-arm control that the measurement can see one.
 *   9. CALLS, NOT DISPATCHES — the module's text: it must import and call the generator rather
 *                   than reach it through the registry, with the frozen oracle as the control.
 *  10. TEETH      — eleven broken twins, each with the number of crafted arms that catches it and
 *                   its catch count in each real session, zeros kept.
 *
 * HOLE: the threshold cell holds one value per session and the crafted arms move it, so what is
 * swept is the DECISION, not the distribution of draws the game really presents.
 * HOLE: the equality case is reached only by a crafted arm whose threshold is set to the byte the
 * generator is about to produce — read off a clone first. No session ever lands on it, and the
 * off-by-one twin that lives there is caught nowhere else.
 * HOLE: the generator itself is gated by its own file. What this file gates is the comparison,
 * the fold and the cycle.
 *
 * WHERE THE STACK POINTER IS OWNED. sp sits inside the excluded ceiling here, so a rewrite that
 * leaked stack without writing memory would pass. assembled-swap.test.js owns that; this gate
 * does not, and says so rather than implying a coverage it does not have.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-382d.test.js
