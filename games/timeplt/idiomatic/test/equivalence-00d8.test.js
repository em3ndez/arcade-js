 * saveAccumulatorForFrameInterrupt — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x00D8, in the DISSOLVED
 * form (see _vblankService.js for the contract every gate in this family shares: memory outside the
 * oracle's measured dead stack scratch, every device, SP).
 *
 * The frozen entry is ONE INSTRUCTION, `push af`, falling into the service body at 0x00D9. Control arrives
 * here three ways — the vector's `jp` at 0x0066 and a `call nz` at each of 0x00A2 and 0x49D0, the last two
 * taken only on a tampered image. The stacked pair is the first word of the register save the close at
 * 0x0174 unwinds; it holds no game state, so the rewrite does not stack it and is simply the service. Its
 * idiomatic callers — the vector, and the two boot-time image checks — all call it directly and it
 * returns, so it pops nothing either.
 *
 * What it exercises, holes stated:
 *   1. REACH — dispatched exactly once per vector dispatch on a genuine image under both tapes (so the
 *      two tampered-image arrivals never fire), with the vector's own count as the positive control.
 *   2. FULL — every captured entry of both tapes: memory outside the dead stack window and every device
 *      identical; SP unmoved when called directly, level with the oracle and on its pc when placed
 *      through the game's dispatch seam.
 *   3. ACCUMULATOR — the dropped `push af` lost nothing: on a real entry all 256 accumulator values under
 *      four flag words leave the rewrite's product unchanged, and the oracle's too outside its dead stack
 *      (so the stacked pair was not an input to anything that survives), with a twin that reads the
 *      accumulator into memory as the control that the sweep can see an input.
 *   4. TEETH — three twins, each caught on the corpus.
 *
 * RETIRED, and why: the frozen gate's WHOLE-MACHINE arm wired this entry into the CYCLE-DRIVEN engine. The
 * dissolved form is not a register-faithful override there (see _vblankService.js); the whole-game gates
 * under runIdiomaticGame — byte-for-byte against the cycle-driven oracle, and SP-INERT — are the arbiter.
 * HOLE: pc and cycles are not compared on a direct call, the ordinary memory-equivalence drop.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/timeplt/idiomatic/test/equivalence-00d8.test.js
