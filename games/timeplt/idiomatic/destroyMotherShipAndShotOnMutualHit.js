 * destroyMotherShipAndShotOnMutualHit — ROM 0x4FE0 [seen]
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. The collision test between the player's bullets and the Mother-Ship, the large
 * two-slot craft whose record starts at MOTHER_SHIP_STATE (0xA8A0) and whose sprite entry is
 * MOTHER_SHIP_ENTRY (0xAA24). The bullets are the six 16-byte shot records at PLAYER_SHOT_ARRAY
 * (0xAA80). Its caller is dispatchEra4CollisionByFrameParity.
 *
 * ROLE. Sweep the six shot slots for one that has reached the Mother-Ship and destroy both. The
 * Mother-Ship's state must be live or the sweep doesn't run. Each slot must be live too, with both
 * coordinates inside a box centred on the Mother-Ship -- not square, and its first axis widened for
 * two of the era values (the only thing the era decides here; the ROM does it by loading a
 * different pair of window constants, not with a second body). A slot that passes takes the
 * destroyed code, the Mother-Ship takes it too, and the chained hit score is posted. The Mother-Ship
 * is tested live only once, before the sweep, so the remaining slots are still run with it already
 * destroyed and one pass can pay for several. Marking it destroyed here is a hit, not necessarily
 * its death: loc_43f0 spends one of the hits it can absorb (record +4) before it dies.
 * Slots step a record at a time without leaving their page.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory.
