/** postNextParachutistBonus — run one slot's countdown down by one and post the next command of a four-step run.
 * The step number is kept in the slot's own record and is read before it is stepped on, so the
 * first visit posts step zero. Each of the four steps supplies its own argument from a table;
 * once the number has gone past the last of them every further visit posts one fixed argument
 * instead, and the number keeps climbing rather than stopping or wrapping. All four steps and the
 * one past them share a single command byte, so what varies from visit to visit is the argument
 * alone. LIVE-OUT: memory.
 *
 * ROM 0x4831-0x484E (frozen lift translated/loc_4831.js). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES
 * 0x4831). Role in the machine: the rescue award for catching a parachutist. Command 4 is the
 * ring's scoring command, and decoding the arguments gives 1,000 / 2,000 / 3,000 / 4,000 and
 * then 5,000 for every rescue after that — a ladder that rises and then caps (names.js,
 * mechanisms.md). The step byte is PARACHUTIST_RUNG (record +7) [seen], zeroed at every life
 * start, so the ladder restarts on death.
 *
 * `record` is the parachutist's slot record (IX in the ROM; PARACHUTIST_RECORD 0xA8F0 in
 * mechanisms.md).
