/** loc_10f8 — give five display-list slots a second appearance, half a screen away.
 *
 * A slot is a pair of bytes and the high bit of the first one is a request. Where it is set the
 * pair trades half a byte range: the requester gives that half up and the partner takes it on,
 * which is what carries the slot into the far half of the display. A slot with no request is
 * stepped over, not stopped at, so a gap in the middle costs the slots after it nothing.
 * The hold that belongs before each trade is not reproduced; the same bytes land either way.
 * LIVE-OUT: memory only.
 *
 * ROM 0x10F8-0x1198 (frozen lift translated/loc_10f8.js): the last five of multiplexSpriteSlots' eight
 * identical 32-byte blocks, one per hardware sprite 19..23. Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x10f8).
 *
 * Role in the machine: Time Pilot has 24 hardware sprites, too few for the player, the enemies and a
 * sky full of clouds, so the eight scenery sprites (0-2 and 19-23) are each shown twice per frame by
 * moving them while the picture is being scanned out (mechanisms.md, sprite doubling). This entry is the
 * waiting pass for sprites 19-23 only: spinRemainingSpriteMultiplexSlots (0x10FD) rejoins it here when
 * sprite 19's line has not come yet, and multiplexSpriteSlots' own pass runs straight through it.
 *
 * Why it keeps a hex name: no call or jump in the image targets 0x10F8 -- only relative branches
 * interior to multiplexSpriteSlots land here, so what the body does is a stretch of that routine's job
 * rather than a job of its own (names.js "why").
 *
 * What "the hold" is: in the ROM each block first spins -- re-reading SCANLINE_COUNTER (0xC000) and
 * adding the request byte to it until the sum carries out of eight bits, i.e. until the raster reaches
 * the line where the sprite has already been drawn once -- and only then trades. Each block also runs a
 * net-zero `inc hl / inc hl / dec hl / dec hl` as a pure delay. Neither changes a byte of memory, so
 * neither appears here.
