 * drainBothDeferredCellLists — one pass of the deferred cell machinery: blank what the last pass painted, paint what is
 * pending now, then COPY the pending list wholesale onto the erase list. Not a swap and not a double buffer: the copy runs
 * one way on every pass, and the two lists hold different jobs rather than alternating ones.
 * That copy is a straight byte copy of the pending list onto the erase list, as many bytes as the
 * pending cursor says are in use, cursor byte included — so it lands the pending count on top of
 * the erase cursor, and the line after replaces that with the same count plus a mark in the top
 * bit. The pending cursor is then parked on its own first entry. Where nothing was pending both
 * cursors are parked instead and no copy happens. A cursor of ZERO is not nothing pending: the
 * count is a block-copy length, and a length of zero means the whole address space.
 * LIVE-OUT: memory.
 *
 * ROM 0x5286-0x52A9 (frozen lift translated/loc_5286.js). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. Part of the first job of every vertical-blank service, "publish the display"
 * (mechanisms.md). Some drawing is not written straight into video RAM -- the player's shots, for
 * one, are character-cell blocks queued by queueTileStampForObject. The queuer appends four-byte
 * entries (address low, address high, glyph, attribute) to the pending list whose cursor is DEFERRED_WRITE_CURSOR (0xAE00, entries from 0xAE04). Once a frame this entry
 * takes back the previous pass's cells, paints the new ones, and records what it just painted so
 * the NEXT pass can take those back in turn. A cell queued once therefore shows for one pass and
 * is then blanked unless it is queued again.
 *
 * The two lists are not a double buffer: blankCellsPaintedLastPass walks the erase list at
 * DEFERRED_BLANK_CURSOR (0xAE80) and writes only the blank glyph into the character plane, leaving
 * colour alone, while paintDeferredCells walks the pending list and writes glyph AND colour. The
 * copy always runs 0xAE00 onto 0xAE80, never back.
