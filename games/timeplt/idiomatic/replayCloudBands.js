/** replayCloudBands — repaint the frame's multiplexed clouds in bands from m.beamPlan. Final RAM keeps
 * only each slot's far-half appearance; reconstruct the near half, paint the rows above its flip line
 * (113 - final Y, since a mid-frame write shows below the beam) in beam order, restore the far half.
 *
 * ROM: none — this is not a transcribed ROM routine and has no names.js entry or grounding tag. It is
 * the game's beam-sync render step (docs/beam-sync.md). Role in the machine: Time Pilot shows each of
 * the eight scenery (cloud) sprites twice in one frame. The multiplexing passes (multiplexSpriteSlots,
 * multiplexSpriteSlotsSkipping, spinRemainingSpriteMultiplexSlots) wait on the raster and, once the beam
 * has passed a sprite's first appearance, move that hardware sprite half the coordinate range away
 * (mechanisms.md). The real board draws the first appearance before the move and the second after it;
 * a single end-of-frame snapshot would see only the second. Each move is recorded in m.beamPlan as the
 * pair of cells it changed — `y`, the bank-1 Y byte that lost 128, and `x`, the bank-0 X byte that
 * gained 128 — and this routine uses them to paint the frame in bands, each from the RAM the beam saw.
 *
 * It is state-neutral: every cell it changes is put back, so the game's RAM ends as it found it.
 * It runs from runCommandRingDrainLoop while the command ring is empty, before that loop yields.
 * LIVE-OUT: the painted bands (through m.paintBeamBand) and an emptied m.beamPlan; memory unchanged.
