/**
 * sampleCellGlyphAndColour — take what is currently showing at one character cell, its glyph byte and
 * the colour byte of the same cell, and lay the two down side by side as a two-byte record.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS: ROM routine 0x1AFC [seen]. The glyph plane and the colour plane hold the same 32x32 grid
 * at the same offset and are told apart by a single address bit (bit 10, 0x400: glyph cells have it
 * set, their colour twins do not), so one pointer reaches both. The cell itself is not touched, so what
 * the caller gets is a reading, not a reservation.
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE: a SAMPLE, not a save-for-restore. stepCopyrightScreenAwaitingStart samples one
 * cell of the copyright line into a record every frame; watched, the glyph half stayed constant while
 * the colour half alternated between 0x05 and 0x10 -- the cell blinks under it and the copy tracks it
 * frame by frame. The only readers of that record are two comparisons inside
 * advancePlayerAnimationStrip, and nothing writes the pair back to any cell, which is what a restore
 * would have to do. parkSpritesAndArmLineWipeThenAdvanceSequence samples a second cell once; what reads
 * that record is unmeasured.
 *
 * PARAMETERS: `cell` is the cell's glyph-plane address (the ROM passes it in HL), `record` the two-byte
 * record to fill (DE).
 * LIVE-OUT: the two record bytes, plus the pointer left on the colour plane, the record cursor stepped
 * to the colour byte, and the colour byte in hand -- exactly the registers the ROM leaves behind.
