 * animateFixedShapeCycleFromShape50 — give one sprite entry the current frame of the eight-frame
 * shape cycle that starts at shape code 0x50, and the fixed attribute 0x0A beside it.
 *
 * ROM 0x41F1-0x4200 (loc_41f1). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x41F1).
 *
 * What it is: like its sibling animateFixedShapeCycle, it dresses one entry of the sprite SHADOW
 * (0xAA10-0xAA6F; shape code at +1, attribute byte — colour and flip — at +0x30) that
 * publishSpriteShadow copies into the hardware sprite banks once a frame. The frame is picked from
 * bits one to three of FRAME_TICK (0xA980) [seen], the once-per-frame counter, so the cycle turns
 * over once every sixteen counts. Nothing about the object is read, so every entry driven through
 * here in the same tick gets the same shape.
 *
 * Why "FromShape50": the two ROM bodies are the same instruction sequence — both select the frame
 * with `ld a,(0xa980) / rrca / and 0x07`, so the two cycles run at the same rate and in step —
 * and only their constants differ: this one starts the cycle at shape 0x50 and pins the
 * attribute to 0x0A, the sibling starts at 0x40 and pins 0x44. The shape base is what the name
 * carries.
 *
 * Role in the machine: its two callers are the era-4 era-object-bank handler
 * stepSlotApproachThenBreakawayRetire (0x4194, on the breakaway arm) and the approach frame it
 * runs, flyTowardShipStandoffThenEndApproach (0x41B8). Under MAME, read taps counted zero
 * dispatches on runs that stayed in eras 0-3 and a steady stream on a run holding ERA_INDEX at 4;
 * on that run it wrote the full eight-frame shape cycle and the fixed byte beside it.
 *
 * Parameter: `sprite` — the address of the sprite-shadow entry to dress (IY in the ROM).
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory only — the shape byte and the byte at +0x30.
