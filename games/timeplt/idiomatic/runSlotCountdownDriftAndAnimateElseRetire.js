 * runSlotCountdownDriftAndAnimateElseRetire — ROM 0x3E8E [seen]
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. The countdown arm of dispatchObjectSlotByHeadByte, the per-slot handler that
 * stepFourActorSlots runs over the four enemy-shot slots (ACTOR_RECORD_SLOT0..3, 0xA810-0xA840).
 * That dispatcher reads only the slot's head byte: 0 is empty, 0xFF is flying, and ANY other value
 * comes here. The ROM passes the slot's state record in IX (here `ix`, byte +0 is the head/counter)
 * and its sprite entry in IY (`iy`).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. Only the last era treats such a head as a countdown animation
 * (mechanisms.md, retiring and hiding). Outside era 4 the slot is retired on the spot. In era 4 a
 * head of 1 retires it; any other value drops by one this frame, a count that came in at 60 or more
 * first clamps the head to 59 and asks for two sounds, and the object drifts with the world. While
 * the count (re-read after the clamp) is 28 or more, the sprite takes one of eight shapes from
 * COUNTDOWN_SLOT_SHAPE_TABLE (0x3EC3), each held for four counts and repeating, with a fixed 3 in
 * its attribute byte. Retiring is the ROM block at 0x40AB (retireSlot [seen]): zero the head and
 * both sprite coordinates, which takes the object off the screen.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory.
