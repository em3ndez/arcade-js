/** pickScriptAtRandomOrInTurn — draw a byte and let one comparison against SCRIPT_PICK_THRESHOLD decide
 * between two answers: at or above the threshold, fold the draw down to one of four values in a band and
 * return it; below it, ignore the draw and return the next entry of a five-long round-robin counter
 * (stepped and wrapped).
 *
 * ROM 0x382D-0x3846 (frozen lift translated/loc_382d.js). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x382D).
 *
 * Role in the machine: chooses the movement script a freshly spawned enemy craft will follow. Its
 * two callers, driveEnemyWaveForLifePhase and spawnEnemyIntoFreeSlotElseStepSearch, store the answer
 * at the new object's +0x0A, and stepShapeAnimation later uses that byte to pick a run from the word
 * table at 0x3438 and walk it (names.js "why"). SCRIPT_PICK_THRESHOLD (0xACC4) is set per round by
 * the era/rung configuration, so a higher threshold biases the game toward the ordered cycle.
 *
 * The two arms answer from DISJOINT ranges — the random arm only 5 to 8, the rotation only 0 to 4 —
 * so which arm ran is recoverable from the answer alone.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: the answer in A (returned), plus the counter on the second path. */
