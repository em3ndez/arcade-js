/** loadActivePlayerContextAndPostRoundHud — set up the active player's turn and guard the picture on a program-image checksum.
 * Blank a run of character cells and copy the active player's saved sixteen-byte context into the
 * live block. When play is inactive, just step the sequence sub-index; otherwise also post the round
 * number and the lives-less-one as commands and fold a fixed program span into an XOR whose low bit,
 * less one, drives the picture-enable latch — darkening the screen if it changed.
 *
 * ROM 0x4C75-0x4CB3 (frozen lift translated/loc_4c75.js). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x4c75).
 *
 * Role in the machine: a sequence arm (computed-dispatch entry 3 of the table at 0x0F29) that
 * starts a turn. Each player's state lives in a sixteen-byte block (player one at 0xAD10, player
 * two at 0xAD20) and the game plays out of the live copy at 0xAD00; this is the swap-in. The two
 * posted commands go to the command ring (postCommand): the round number, and the lives count
 * less one that names.js (LIVES_REMAINING) identifies as the reserve display. The checksum is a
 * tamper guard: names.js records that the program-image checksums fold into VIDEO_ENABLE_LATCH so
 * that a patched image blanks the picture.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory only. */
