/** requestTwoSoundsWhilePlaying — ask for two sounds in a row. This entry supplies the first code, fetched from a byte of the program
 * image rather than carried as an immediate, and leaves through the entry that supplies the second; both go in under
 * the same permission, so a state that refuses one drops the pair together. LIVE-OUT: memory.
 *
 * ROM 0x566E-0x5673, running on into 0x5674. Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x566e).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. Its caller is commissionStagedAttackerByEra. The permission is
 * enqueueSoundIfGameInProgress, which drops a request while no game is being played; its
 * structural twin requestTwoSounds differs only in using the door that also admits the demo.
