 * hasReachedBoundaryBandSelectedByHeading — answer whether an object has arrived at a boundary, choosing
 * WHICH boundary from the heading in its record.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS: ROM 0x3CC4-0x3CD8, tag [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x3cc4). The heading picks which of two
 * adjacent and disjoint three-wide bands is tested on the sprite entry's byte at +0x31. When that band
 * test misses, a second, four-wide window test on the same sprite entry's head byte
 * (hasReachedHorizontalEdgeWindow) decides -- so the answer is the OR of the two tests.
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE: advanceTwoTileObjectThenTryAimedSpawn uses it as the retire test for its
 * two-tile object: on a yes the object is retired, otherwise it is dressed and
 * the aimed-spawn attempt runs (names.js 0x3b77).
 *
 * No memory is written. LIVE-OUT: the answer, returned (the ROM's carry).
