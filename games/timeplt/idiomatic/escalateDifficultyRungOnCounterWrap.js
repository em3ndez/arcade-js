/** escalateDifficultyRungOnCounterWrap — advance a three-place base-sixty tick counter; each time the lowest place rolls
 * over, count down a reload timer, and each time that timer fires rearm it, climb the escalation rung one step toward
 * its ceiling, and apply the row that rung selects.
 *
 * ROM 0x4D3A-0x4D66 (lift: translated/loc_4d3a.js). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x4D3A).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. This is how the game gets harder DURING a life. Its one caller is the round
 * engine's per-dispatch service (serviceRoundThenResolvePlayerState), so it runs once per round-engine
 * pass, not once per frame. The difficulty within an era is one of sixteen rows of a tuning table,
 * chosen by the era (high nibble) and ERA_RUNG 0xACC0 [seen] (low nibble); applyEraRungSettings
 * scatters the chosen row over the spawner caps, aim windows, cooldowns and thresholds. The rung
 * climbs once every ERA_RUNG_PERIOD x 60 passes (mechanisms.md, the escalation rung).
 *
 * The counter is LIFE_TICKS_LOW 0xAD05 [seen] and the two places above it (0xAD06, 0xAD07), each a
 * packed-decimal byte that rolls over at 60. It is NOT a clock (names.js LIFE_TICKS_LOW): it counts
 * passes of this service, and other subsystems read its low place as a phase.
 * LIVE-OUT: memory. */
