/** serviceEra4EnemyCraftSlot — service one object slot by its lifecycle byte: idle when free, release when held,
 * step when dying, and when live steer it, retire it on the line, else animate and try a launch. */

/*
 * ROM 0x29D5-0x29F6, grounding [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x29d5).
 *
 * ROLE. Word 4 of the era table at 0x2914 that dispatchSeatedSlotByEraIndex runs when ERA_INDEX
 * (0xAD04) is 4 -- the fifth and last era (A.D. 2001, flying saucers, in gameplay.md). Called once per
 * frame per seated enemy-craft slot. Same skeleton as the other era services, with two differences:
 * steering and flying are one call (steerEnemyTowardShip), and instead of pointing the sprite along a
 * heading it plays a four-frame shape cycle (animateSelectedShapeCycle).
 *
 * PARAMETERS. `ix` is the slot's 16-byte object record (lifecycle byte at +0); `iy` is its two-byte
 * sprite entry -- named for the Z80 index registers the ROM carries them in; the defaults read those
 * registers for a caller that still seats them there.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory only -- the slot's record and sprite entry, and whatever the launch helpers seat.
