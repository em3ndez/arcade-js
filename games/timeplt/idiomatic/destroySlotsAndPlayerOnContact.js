 * destroySlotsAndPlayerOnContact — ROM 0x5152 [seen]
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. A contact sweep that runs the player's own ship against a run of object slots,
 * destroying the player along with whatever it touches. Per names.js a MAME write tap caught this routine storing the destroyed
 * marker into PLAYER_STATE (0xA800) during a driven game -- the shots-against-targets sweeps never
 * touch the player's state.
 *
 * ROLE. Run the player against a run of slots and, for each one that overlaps, mark BOTH as hit
 * and post the score for it. The sweep does not stop at the first, and the player's own mark is
 * re-stamped each time, so one pass can take several slots. It is refused outright unless the
 * player is still whole, and a slot is skipped unless it is whole too. Overlap is two windows on
 * two axes: the caller supplies the bias and the width for one, the other is fixed at eight either
 * side. A run of zero slots means a full two hundred and fifty-six.
 *
 * PARAMETERS: records = the first slot's record (its state byte; DE in the ROM); entries = the
 * first slot's sprite entry (IY); slots = how many slots to sweep (B); bias and width = the
 * first-axis window (L and H). Its callers (runAllCollisionSweepsThisFrame,
 * splitCollisionWorkByFrameParity) pass bias 7 and width 15, a first-axis reach of 7 either side.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory, plus the two cursors (record in E, entry in IY). They are handed back one past
 * the last slot (the record cursor steps its low half only, the entry cursor whole) for a caller
 * that tail-runs another sweep on the same run of slots; on the early refusal neither moves.
 *
 * RETURN VALUE: the same cursor pair as { record, entry } (each u16-wrapped), so a caller that runs
 * another sweep next can continue from it without reading the registers back. The register writes
 * are unchanged and remain the declared behaviour; on the early refusal neither register is
 * written and the pair echoes the un-advanced input cursors.
