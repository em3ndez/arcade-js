 * snapHeadingOntoTheTurnTarget — ROM 0x1F3E [seen]
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. The arm of the player's turn that ends it: the ship's heading is set exactly to the
 * heading it was turning toward, and the world is then scrolled for it. The ROM is two instructions,
 * `ld a,b` / `ld (0xa802),a`, falling into the world scroll at 0x1F42 (scrollWorldAtTheEraPace [seen]).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. The other arms of the turn STEP the live heading by 3 or 4 (chosen from
 * ERA_INDEX's low nibble) toward a target taken from the direction table at 0x1F2E. Targets are 32
 * apart and 3 does not divide 32, so a walk of 3s lands 2 short, fails the guard and overshoots to
 * one past. This arm is taken when the live heading is one either side of the target (live minus
 * target is 0xFF or 0x01), and writes the target itself -- a snap.
 * No transfer targets this address: turnShipTowardTargetHeading runs these instructions inline, so
 * this file stands for that arm (names.js).
 *
 * PARAMETER: `target` -- the heading being turned toward (the ROM's B, loaded at 0x1F05 and not
 * written again before here). LIVE-OUT: memory.
