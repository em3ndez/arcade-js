/** loc_59c5 — hand back the doubled component pair a heading handed straight in calls for, at the
 * pace one fixed table of samples sets; choosing that table is all this entry does. LIVE-OUT: the pair.
 *
 * ROM 0x59C5-0x59CA (frozen lift translated/loc_59c5.js: `ld hl,0x59d7 / jp 0x59a0`).
 * Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x59c5).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. doubledVelocityForHeading (0x59A0) turns a heading — a point on a 256-step
 * circle — into two perpendicular 16-bit velocity components read from a table of samples, each
 * doubled. It takes the table in HL and the heading in A. This shim seats the table and tail-jumps
 * in, so the heading is whatever value the caller put in A; unlike loc_598e it does not read an
 * object record. Its caller is spawnAimedEnemyIntoEraBankWhenInWindow, which hands in the heading
 * it has just aimed and stores the returned pair as the new enemy's velocity.
 *
 * The table is loc_59d7 (0x59D7), the ROM table of 256 16-bit velocity words — the same table
 * loc_598e seats. loc_59cb and loc_59d1 are this entry with the other two table immediates.
