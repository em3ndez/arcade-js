/** tallyCoinSlot1AndAwardCredit — one frame of coin slot 1's accounting. The raw coin line is clocked into a debounce
 * shift register and only a clean rising edge (its low three bits reading 1) counts as a coin: it
 * blips the coin sound, bumps the tally, and adds a unit to the coins-inserted accumulator. Once the
 * accumulator passes the coinage threshold (coins-required-minus-one in the high nibble, credits awarded in
 * the low), the overshoot is carried forward and — unless the no-credit flag is set — the low nibble
 * is added to the packed-decimal credit count (saturated at 99) and its panel repainted. Either way
 * the mechanical coin counter is pulsed. LIVE-OUT: memory, plus the latched counter line.
 *
 * ROM 0x4941-0x4983 (frozen lift translated/loc_4941.js), falling into pulseSlot1CoinCounter at
 * 0x4984. Grounding: [seen] in names.js.
 *
 * The three slot-1 cells sit together: COIN_SLOT_1_DEBOUNCE 0xA9C7 (history of the coin line, one bit
 * per frame), COIN_SLOT_1_ACCUMULATOR 0xA9C8 (coins so far, 0x10 per coin) and COIN_SLOT_1_RATIO 0xA9C9
 * (the coinage the operator's DIP switches chose, unpacked at boot). The flat one-credit input on
 * IN0 bit 2 is handled separately, by awardOneCreditOnDebouncedInputEdge. */
