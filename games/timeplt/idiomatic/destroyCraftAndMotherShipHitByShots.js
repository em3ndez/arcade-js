/**
 * destroyCraftAndMotherShipHitByShots — the player's shot sweeps for the stretch of a round in which the
 * Mother-Ship is on the field: sweep the six player shots against FIVE ordinary craft instead of the usual
 * seven, then run the same six shots against the Mother-Ship itself.
 *
 * ROM 0x4FBF-0x5031. Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x4FBF). The second sweep is the code the ROM falls
 * into at 0x4FE0 (destroyMotherShipAndShotOnMutualHit); it is not called.
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. dispatchShotSweepByMotherShipArmed sends the frame's shot sweep here while
 * MOTHER_SHIP_ARMED is set, and to a seven-craft sweep otherwise. The Mother-Ship's record is the one at
 * MOTHER_SHIP_STATE (0xA8A0) [seen] and the one a stride on — the last two of the seven ordinary craft slots
 * from CRAFT_RECORD_SLOT0 (0xA850) [seen] (0xA850 plus five strides of 0x10 is 0xA8A0). So while it is out,
 * only the first five craft slots hold craft; choosing the shorter run is the whole of what this entry adds
 * to the first sweep (names.js "why").
 *
 * SWEEP 1 — the craft. destroyTargetsHitByShots (ROM 0x5211) is handed the shot array (PLAYER_SHOT_ARRAY
 * 0xAA80 [seen]), the craft sprite entries (CRAFT_ENTRY_SLOT0 0xAA1A [seen]) and records, five targets, six
 * shots and its hit box; the two scratch cursor cells it reloads between passes are staged first.
 *
 * SWEEP 2 — the Mother-Ship. Runs only while its state byte reads 0xFF (live). Every live shot is tested
 * against the Mother-Ship's position on both axes; a shot inside the box sets BOTH the Mother-Ship's state and
 * the shot's state to 0xF0 ("just hit") and posts a score (postChainedHitScore, ROM 0x51DE). The loop does
 * not re-test the Mother-Ship's state after a hit, so several shots landing in one frame each score.
 * The box on the first axis depends on the era (ERA_INDEX [seen]): wider in eras 0 and 4.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory-only.
