/** driftAtHalfWorldScroll — drift one object by half of a displacement that is not its own.
 * Each of the object's two coordinates is 16 bits stored split: the whole part off one base,
 * the fraction off the other. Both gain the shared world displacement rather than anything read
 * off the object, halved on the way in, so this keeps half the pace of one that takes the whole
 * of it. The fraction carries into the whole, so a coordinate moves and wraps as one number.
 * LIVE-OUT: memory, four bytes; the second moved coordinate is also left standing.
 *
 * ROM 0x2DF4-0x2E18 (frozen lift loc_2df4). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x2DF4).
 *
 * Role in the machine: Time Pilot's ship never moves on the glass. Each frame its velocity is
 * turned into a displacement, negated, and stored in WORLD_SCROLL_Y (0xA808) [seen] and
 * WORLD_SCROLL_X (0xA80A) [seen]; everything else on screen is moved by that displacement so the
 * world appears to fly past. Scenery gets parallax from three sibling routines, each moving an
 * object by a different fraction of the displacement — this one (half),
 * driftAtThreeQuartersWorldScroll (three quarters) and driftAtFiveQuartersWorldScroll (five
 * quarters). This is the slowest rung: an object on it lags the world furthest. Its callers are the
 * scenery wrappers dispatched by the era-keyed scenery dispatcher, every dispatch seated inside the
 * scenery slots (names.js; mechanisms.md, the scroll and scenery section).
 *
 * Parameters: `object` is the object record (IX in the ROM), holding the fractional byte of each
 * coordinate; `sprite` is its sprite entry (IY in the ROM), holding the whole byte of each
 * coordinate — the bytes the video hardware reads as the sprite's position.
 *
 * "Left standing": displaceByHalf also leaves its result in HL, so after the second coordinate
 * HL still holds that coordinate's moved 16-bit value, as it does after the ROM's own last call.
