/**
 * advanceCharCursor — step the character-cell cursor on to the next cell of the line being drawn.
 *
 * ROM 0x0020-0x0026 (loc_0020). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x0020).
 *
 * What it is: the one-cell "move right" of every text and digit drawer. The character plane is a
 * tilemap laid out in rows of thirty-two cells, so the cell that follows the current one ON SCREEN
 * is thirty-two addresses further DOWN the plane, not one address up. The monitor is mounted
 * rotated (MAME's ROT90, clockwise): a decreasing native row maps to an increasing display column,
 * which is why subtracting a row's worth of cells reads as moving along a line of text.
 *
 * Role in the machine: paintTwoUnsuppressedDigitsFromByte draws a two-digit pair as high nibble,
 * step, low nibble, so this step is reading order; every base those drawers feed it lies inside
 * video RAM. Its exact inverse is retreatCharCursor (RST 0x28, +32), which paintDigitDroppingLeadingZero
 * calls on a blanked digit so that the drawer's following step nets to zero and the digit consumes no cell.
 *
 * Parameter: `cursor` — the 16-bit tilemap address of the cell just drawn (the DE pair in the ROM).
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: the stepped cursor, nothing else — no memory is read or written.

  // a 16-bit "minus thirty-two", wrapped to sixteen bits, which is what u16 reproduces here.
