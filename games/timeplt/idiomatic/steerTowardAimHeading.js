/** steerTowardAimHeading — turn an object's heading one step toward the heading it aims at, the
 * short way round, at a rate a small table supplies for the current era.
 *
 * ROLE. The object's record (IX) carries its current heading at +0x02 -- the heading field every
 * actor family shares -- and the heading it is aiming for at +0x01. The heading byte written here
 * is the one the object's own movement routine reads to pick a velocity, so stepping it one notch
 * per call makes the object curve toward its target. The two headings are points on a 256-step
 * circle, so their difference taken as a wrapped byte says how far round the aim lies: under half a
 * turn away and the short way is forward (add), otherwise it is back (subtract). The size of a step
 * is not the object's own -- it is fetched from TURN_RATE_BY_ERA_TABLE (five entries at 0x2C1D)
 * indexed by whatever ERA_INDEX holds at the call; steerEnemyTowardShip forces that cell to 0 around
 * some of its turns (mechanisms.md), so two objects turning in one frame need not turn alike.
 *
 * ROM 0x2BEF-0x2C1C (frozen lift translated/loc_2bef.js). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES
 * 0x2bef). LIVE-OUT: memory only, one byte, and nothing at all once the aim is reached.
