/** postGameOverBanner — the last life is gone: queue the PLAYER-n caption and then the GAME OVER
 * caption, hold them by arming the sequence countdown, and step the inner sequence index on. The
 * first pair's argument goes up by one while the second player is the one up, which is what picks
 * PLAYER 2 over PLAYER 1.
 * The routine also carries an arm that has nothing to do with a banner: reached with play NOT
 * active, it hands off to restartAttractSequence and never comes back here. That arm has never
 * been seen taken.
 * LIVE-OUT: memory only.
 *
 * ROM 0x1253-0x126E plus the tail `jp 0x0f1a` (frozen lift translated/loc_1253.js, whose span
 * 0x1253-0x1318 also inlines the restartAttractSequence body at 0x12FB). Grounding: [seen]
 * (names.js ROUTINES 0x1253).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. loseLifeAndHandOver calls this when the active player's life count reaches
 * zero. Captions are not drawn here: the main loop's command ring carries (command, argument)
 * pairs to drawing routines run later, and postCommand queues one pair. names.js records, from
 * MAME, that command 2 is drawCaptionInPenColour and command 10 its sibling
 * drawCaptionFivePastSharedColour (colour = PEN_COLOUR + 5), and that arguments 9 / 10 and 11 are caption records PLAYER 1 / PLAYER 2 and
 * GAME OVER. The countdown then holds the banner: SEQUENCE_DELAY is the sequence machine's shared
 * one-shot delay, and the next sub-step counts it down before it files the score.
 *
 * "Never seen taken" for the attract arm is names.js's record of restartAttractSequence: the
 * `jp z` at 0x1257 was never taken under MAME.
