/** stepThirteenScriptedGlyphCells — step thirteen cells of the character plane on by one shape each, but only where a
 * script says so. The script is walked through one shared cursor cell, a byte per plane cell, and
 * a byte of zero leaves its cell alone; the cursor is left where the walk ended rather than
 * rewound, so a caller wanting those thirteen bytes again must put it back itself. Two bits of
 * one incoming byte set the directions independently: the low bit turns the walk round, so the
 * script is read backwards and the shape steps DOWN instead of up, and the next bit decides
 * whether the plane cells are taken a row down or a row up from the one given.
 *
 * ROM 0x4A9D-0x4ACB (frozen lift translated/loc_4a9d.js). Grounding: [seen].
 *
 * Role in the machine: the shared inner step of the two scripted band drawers,
 * advanceScriptedCharPlaneBandTo2 and advanceScriptedCharPlaneBandTo4, which call it on pairs of
 * thirteen-cell runs with different direction bits. They share BAND_SCRIPT_CURSOR 0xA9F7 with it,
 * which is why the cursor is not rewound here.
 *
 * `firstCell` is the plane address of the first cell of the run (DE on the Z80); `directions` is
 * the incoming byte (C on the Z80): bit 0 = backwards/down, bit 1 = up the plane.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory-only. */
