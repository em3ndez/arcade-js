/** loc_0f8d — the image-checksum tamper trap. The original drops four return words off the stack to
 * unwind its caller chain, runs the sprite fixup pass on the low byte of the fourth, and returns through
 * a fifth. This layer lays no return words (every routine is a direct call and the frame interrupt fires
 * as one), so there is no chain on the stack to unwind and no faithful transcription of the unwind; it
 * raises where the transfer lands instead. It is reached only when the one image block the credit line
 * folds does not total 0x67, and that block is fixed program bytes, so a genuine image never arrives
 * here. No cell is read or written before the raise. LIVE-OUT: none — it never returns. */
