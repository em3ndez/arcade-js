// ROLE IN THE MACHINE. Time Pilot splits its per-frame collision work across two frames. names.js
// records dispatchCollisionPassByEra (0x4E4F) sending odd frames here (outside eras 1 and 4), and the
// era-1 frame-parity splitter doing the same: on those frames the player's shots are tested against
// the enemy craft. This entry decides WHICH shot sweep runs, and for one of the two it also sets the
// sweep up.
//
// LIVE-OUT: memory only -- SCRATCH_PTR_A/SCRATCH_PTR_B, plus every kill, spent shot and score the
// chosen sweep writes.

//   TARGETS -- B = 7 (`ld a,0x07` / `ld b,a` at 0x4F48), and the same 7 parked in A' for 0x5211
//              to reload between passes, so the first pass is no shorter than the rest: the
//              seven-slot craft band.
//   REACH   -- L = 7 (0x4F56), the half-width added before the bound test.
