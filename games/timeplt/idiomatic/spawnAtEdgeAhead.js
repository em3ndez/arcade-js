/** spawnAtEdgeAhead — on a cooldown, and only on alternate frames, place a free slot at the
 * field-edge position the player's current heading selects, clear its sub-pixel remainders and
 * mark it live.
 *
 * ROLE. A singleton spawner: its caller seats one dedicated object record (IX) and that object's
 * sprite entry (IY) before calling this (mechanisms.md derives it as the parachutist's manager).
 * Three things hold it off:
 * MOTHER_SHIP_ARMED must read zero (the parachutist spawn refuses outright while the Mother-Ship
 * is up), bit 0 of FRAME_TICK must be set (so it acts only every other frame), and the record's own
 * delay byte is counted down on each frame it does act and only lets the placing happen when it
 * reaches zero. The heading is rounded to the nearer of sixteen equal sectors and selects a
 * coordinate pair from EDGE_SPAWN_COORD_TABLE -- positions near a field border, lying roughly in
 * the direction the player is flying, so the object appears ahead of the ship. The pair goes to
 * the sprite entry, four working bytes of the record are reset, and the record is marked live
 * LAST, so the slot is never live with stale contents.
 *
 * ROM 0x4853-0x488C (frozen lift translated/loc_4853.js). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES
 * 0x4853). LIVE-OUT: memory -- the record's delay, reset fields and state, and the entry's two
 * coordinate bytes.
