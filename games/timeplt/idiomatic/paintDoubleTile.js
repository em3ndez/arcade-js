/** paintDoubleTile — lay down a two-cell mark at the cursor and step the cursor past it. The pair of codes is consecutive:
 * the caller supplies the lower and the upper is one on from it, the upper going into the cell the cursor names and
 * the lower into the cell below it. Both cells then get the caller's colour, reached by clearing one bit of the
 * address, and the cursor comes back across that bit before it steps. Where the borrow or the carry crosses a plane,
 * the cells the mark and the colour land in part company; the arithmetic is written out so that they can.
 *
 * ROM 0x0E9C-0x0EAB (frozen lift translated/loc_0e9c.js). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x0E9C).
 *
 * Role in the machine: one member of a family of pictogram painters named by BLOCK SIZE. Its caller
 * drawCountAsPictogramStrip (ring command 6, the round-number HUD) splits a count into thirties,
 * tens, fives and ones and paints a pictogram for each one of those; this two-tile block is the
 * one the count of FIVES drives. names.js records the check: posting command 6 with 37 dispatched this
 * routine exactly once, laying codes 0x32 and 0x33 with colour 0x11 a plane below.
 *
 * The screen: the character plane (glyphs, based at 0xA400) and the colour plane (based at 0xA000)
 * hold the same grid at the same offsets, told apart only by address bit 10 (0x0400).
 *
 * Parameters (and their ROM registers): `cursor` the character-plane cell to paint (DE — the ROM
 * swaps it into HL for the writes and back); `code` the lower code of the pair (B); `colour` the
 * colour byte for both cells (C).
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory, plus the stepped cursor. */
