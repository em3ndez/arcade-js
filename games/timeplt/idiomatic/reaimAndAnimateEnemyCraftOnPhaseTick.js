 * reaimAndAnimateEnemyCraftOnPhaseTick — ROM 0x31B4 [seen]
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. A round-robin servicer for the seven enemy-craft slots. Rather than re-aim every craft
 * every frame, the ROM spreads the work over the life tick counter LIFE_TICKS_LOW (0xAD05 [seen]),
 * a packed-decimal byte zeroed when a life starts and observed under MAME only at 00-59 (and a
 * pre-wrap 60). Its two digits are used
 * separately: the tens digit decides WHAT is done this pass, the units digit WHICH craft gets it.
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. On a tens digit of 0 or 3 (ticks 00-09 and 30-39) the craft whose slot number
 * equals the units digit is serviced -- its shape animation advanced and its heading re-aimed at an
 * aim point -- so each of slots 0-6 comes up twice per pass of the counter through 00-59 (units
 * digits 7-9 service nothing).
 * On every other tens digit the pass instead goes to layOutEnemyAimPointsFromScrollAngle (0x326C
 * [seen]), which rebuilds those aim points around the ship. A craft's record (CRAFT_RECORD_SLOT0
 * 0xA850 [seen], 16 bytes a slot) holds its occupancy at +0, heading at +1 and state byte at +8; its
 * sprite entry (CRAFT_ENTRY_SLOT0 0xAA1A [seen], 2 bytes a slot) is where it is on screen.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory only -- the craft record's shape, heading and state bytes (or the aim-point
 * object, on the lay-out passes).
