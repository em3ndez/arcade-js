/**
 * retireSlotAndSubPixel — take an object out of play, zeroing each coordinate WHOLE: occupancy byte,
 * both sub-pixel remainders, and both sprite-entry coordinates.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS: ROM routine 0x2BDE [seen]. Five unconditional zero stores and no reads: the slot byte
 * that marks the object occupied, the two sub-pixel remainders carrying the fractional part of its
 * motion, and both coordinates of its sprite entry.
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE: one of two per-family retire helpers. Its sibling retireSlot leaves the
 * sub-pixel remainders standing; this one clears them too. No file calls both, and spawn paths differ
 * on whether they reinitialise those cells, so which helper retired a slot can still be visible to its
 * next occupant.
 *
 * PARAMETERS: `slot` is the object's state record (the ROM passes it in IX), `sprite` its sprite entry
 * (IY). LIVE-OUT: memory only -- the five bytes written.
