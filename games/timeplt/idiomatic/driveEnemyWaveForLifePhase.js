 * driveEnemyWaveForLifePhase — the enemy-wave step of the round engine.
 *
 * ROM 0x36AF. Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x36af).
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. Enemy craft arrive in waves. How they arrive depends on the era and on how long the
 * current life has lasted: the life-tick counter (LIFE_TICKS_LOW 0xAD05 / LIFE_TICKS_MID 0xAD06, the
 * low and middle places of a base-sixty counter stepped once per round-engine dispatch) is split into
 * "phases" by the low nibble of its middle place, and each phase runs a different spawner. Late in a
 * life (phase nine and up) this routine builds a fresh wave itself, inline: it fills free slots of
 * the seven-slot enemy-craft band (records from CRAFT_RECORD_SLOT0 0xA850, sprite entries from
 * CRAFT_ENTRY_SLOT0 0xAA1A) with craft seated at points on the screen's edge. A ROM wave descriptor
 * picks each point from a table of edge positions, offset by the direction the player is flying,
 * and each craft is headed opposite the player's own heading.
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. Called once per dispatch of the round engine's service list
 * (serviceRoundThenResolvePlayerState). Nothing happens while ROUND_TRANSITION_HOLD (0xACC6) is
 * nonzero -- during the Mother-Ship's destruction and the round hand-over no new waves come.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory.
