/** serviceVerticalBlankInterrupt — the vertical-blank service, the game's per-frame heartbeat. Refresh
 * the sprite banks and the deferred-cell lists, disarm the interrupt line and kick the watchdog, settle
 * the flip-screen line, latch the five inverted input/dip ports, step the frame and packed-decimal
 * counters, wind three timers down toward zero, service the coin inputs, then run one arm of the
 * sequence machine — the one the low two bits of the sequence phase select — and close the frame.
 * In the original the service stacks both register banks on entry and unstacks them on exit so the
 * interrupted code resumes undisturbed; that bracket holds no game state, so it is not represented.
 * LIVE-OUT: memory, the control latches, and what the sound send leaves latched.
 *
 * ROM 0x00D9-0x015E (serviceVerticalBlankInterrupt_ADDR), entered from the interrupt vector 0x0066
 * via the one-byte `push af` at 0x00D8; the arm table follows at 0x015F and the epilogue at 0x0174.
 * Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x00D9), as are the routines around it (enterVblankInterrupt,
 * saveAccumulatorForFrameInterrupt, and each callee here).
 *
 * Role in the machine: everything the game does happens once per frame, from here. The board raises
 * its non-maskable interrupt at vertical blank, between one picture and the next, and this
 * service does the frame's work in a fixed order
 * (mechanisms.md, "The vertical-blank service"). The foreground loop (runCommandRingDrainLoop) only
 * draws the text this frame work asks for.
