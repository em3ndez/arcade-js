/** dressPlayerSpriteForHeading — refresh one fixed sprite entry's shape and the byte beside it from the direction
 * cell. The direction is a point on a 256-step circle; rounded to the nearest of thirty-two equal
 * sectors it indexes two parallel thirty-two-entry tables in the program image, the first holding
 * the shape and the second the byte that goes with it. LIVE-OUT: memory-only.
 *
 * ROM 0x20AF-0x20CD (frozen lift translated/loc_20af.js). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. The player's ship never moves on the screen -- the world scrolls past it --
 * so the only thing that shows which way it faces is its SHAPE. This entry keeps the player's
 * sprite entry (PLAYER_SPRITE_CODE 0xAA11, entry +1, and PLAYER_SPRITE_ATTRIBUTE 0xAA40, its colour/flip
 * byte at entry +0x30) in step with PLAYER_HEADING (0xA802, byte +2 of the player's record).
 * resetPlayfieldAndArmNewRound calls it when a life starts, and
 * negateVelocityIntoWorldScrollThenDressSprite calls it after turning the player's velocity into
 * the world scroll. Under MAME the entry matched the two tables on every sampled frame while the
 * ship was alive (names.js).
