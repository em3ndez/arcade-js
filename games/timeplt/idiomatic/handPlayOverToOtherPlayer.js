/** handPlayOverToOtherPlayer — give the turn to the other player: flip the one-bit active-player
 * index, re-arm the shared sequence delay, reseat the inner sequence index from a program byte.
 * Flipping the index IS the hand-over: every per-player cell is reached through it, nothing is
 * copied, and the skip arm writes the other two cells too. LIVE-OUT: memory, three cells.
 *
 * ROM 0x1226-0x123A (lift: translated/loc_1226.js). Grounding: [seen].
 *
 * Role in the machine: in a two-player game, when a turn ends, passTurnToOtherPlayerIfLivesElseStepSequence
 * comes here only if the first byte of the save block the index does NOT select is non-zero — a
 * one-player start writes zero there, so a one-player
 * game never reaches it (under MAME: nine dispatches with a two-player start, zero with one).
 * ACTIVE_PLAYER (0xAD32) is the whole of the two-player machinery: the save blocks, the score
 * triple, the score drawer and the turn caption are all reached through it, 0 naming player one.
