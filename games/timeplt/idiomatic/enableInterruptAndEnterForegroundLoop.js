/** enableInterruptAndEnterForegroundLoop — open the frame interrupt and enter the foreground for good. The

 * line, the watchdog, and whatever the loop leaves.

 * Role in the machine: this is the hinge between boot and the running game. Everything before it is
 * the one-time cold start (clear memory, verify the image, seed the settings); everything after it is
 * the two halves the game lives in for ever -- the frame interrupt, which does the game's work once
 * per vertical blank, and the foreground loop, which draws whatever text the frame work asks for.
 * Boot wrote 0 into every latch line earlier, so the frame interrupt stays shut until THIS store.
 *
 * `setting` is the byte the caller carries in; names.js records that under MAME it is the program
 * byte at 0x4C87, which reads 0x01 -- so in practice this store switches the interrupt ON.
