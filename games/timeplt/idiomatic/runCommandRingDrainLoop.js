/** runCommandRingDrainLoop — the foreground loop: take commands off the 64-cell ring, one at a time, for ever.
 *  A read cursor names a cell; high bit set means empty, so the loop looks again — it has no exit
 *  of its own. An occupied cell gives up a command and an argument byte, BOTH freed before the
 *  command runs so it may reuse the pair. The low nibble picks one of sixteen handlers out of a
 *  table fixed in the program image; each case below is the handler its slot names, handed the
 *  argument byte, and when it finishes the loop looks again. A GENERATOR, yielding where the ring
 *  is empty — the only vblank wait among the foreground loops a coin-and-play tape reaches. A
 *  handler that restarts the machine hands back the new foreground, and the loop gives way to it
 *  for good. LIVE-OUT: memory, and whatever the command left behind.
 *
 *  ROM 0x0B93-0x0BBB; handler table at 0x0BBC (COMMAND_HANDLER_TABLE). [seen]
 *
 *  Role in the machine: Time Pilot splits its work between two contexts. The frame interrupt decides
 *  what happens (the sequence machine, the round engine) but does not draw text itself: it posts a
 *  two-byte request -- command and argument -- into COMMAND_RING at 0xAC00 through postCommand
 *  (RST 0x38), which advances COMMAND_WRITE_CURSOR. This loop is the consumer: in the time left over
 *  between frame interrupts it takes the requests in order and runs the drawing / scoring handler
 *  each names (mechanisms.md, "The command ring"). The machine stays in this loop from the moment
 *  enableInterruptAndEnterForegroundLoop enters it.
