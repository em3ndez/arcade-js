/**
 * drawRoundNumberCaption — paint the round number as two decimal digits inside its caption frame, then
 * verify a fixed block of program bytes (an anti-tamper guard).
 *
 * ROM 0x0EAC-0x0EEA. Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x0EAC).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. Command 7 of the command table at 0x0BBC (its dispatch word is at 0x0BCA), run by the
 * foreground loop runCommandRingDrainLoop when that command comes off the ring. The round-start arm posts it
 * when ROUND_ARMED is set (names.js: the round-start arm's entry, and 0x0BBC slot 7 = this routine). The number is ROUND_NUMBER (0xAD01) [seen], the unwrapped round count that keeps
 * climbing past the fifth era, which is why it can need two digits — and why 100 and above draw nothing.
 *
 * DRAWING. The caption frame (caption 0x0E) is painted first in the live pen colour, then the character
 * cursor is stepped back two cells onto the digit positions. Each digit is
 * painted by paintDigitDroppingLeadingZero (ROM 0x0EEB) in PEN_COLOUR (0xAD0C) [seen]; the tens may be dropped
 * as a leading zero, the ones never.
 *
 * THE CHECK. The 16 program bytes at 0x1748 (the start of holdCopyrightThenEraseTheCoinInvitation, read as
 * data) are added onto a seed of 0x8C; on the genuine image the total wraps to exactly zero (checked against
 * the ROM image). The ROM sends any other total to 0x2509 (`jp nz`); the port throws instead of running on.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory.
