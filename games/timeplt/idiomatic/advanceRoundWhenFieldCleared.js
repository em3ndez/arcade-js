 * advanceRoundWhenFieldCleared — end the round once the field is empty: when the kill quota is spent,
 * a round transition is being held, and every object slot is free, queue the transition sounds and
 * either (attract demo) restart the attract sequence, or (a real game) start the next round and save
 * the player's context.
 *
 * ROM 0x1271-0x12C6 plus 0x12FB-0x1318 (the demo arm jumps over a table and code at 0x12C7-0x12FA).
 * Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x1271; only the 0xAD10 copy destination was watched under
 * MAME, the 0xAD20 copy is code-level).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. Called once per pass of the round engine's service list,
 * serviceRoundThenResolvePlayerState. Most passes it returns at the first gate. The three gates are:
 *   - KILLS_REMAINING (0xAD02) [seen] is zero: the round's quota of enemy craft has been destroyed;
 *   - ROUND_TRANSITION_HOLD (0xACC6) [seen] is non-zero: the Mother-Ship's destruction has raised the
 *     transition hold (names.js: "The round advances only when this is set, the kill quota ...");
 *   - all fifteen object records from ACTOR_RECORD_SLOT0 (0xA810) [seen], stride 0x10, read zero —
 *     every object has left the field, so nothing is still dying or flying off.
 *
 * The two arms are chosen by PLAY_ACTIVE (0xAD30) [seen], which is clear during the attract demo and set
 * for the whole of a credited game.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory only.
