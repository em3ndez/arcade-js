/** pulseSlot1CoinCounter — drive one pulse of the mechanical counter for each coin the machine still owes, one
 * pulse at a time. With nothing owed it does nothing at all. Otherwise a frame timer runs the
 * pulse: idle, it is loaded to its full length and the counter line is driven high; running, it
 * drops by one a frame, the line is driven low again exactly at the half-way count, and on the
 * frame it reaches zero the debt drops by one instead — so the next owed pulse starts on the
 * frame after, and a debt of two comes out as two separate pulses rather than one long one.
 * The line is a latch, not memory, so nothing here reads back what it wrote.
 * LIVE-OUT: memory, plus the latched line.
 *
 * ROM: 0x4984. Tag [seen] (names.js). Role in the machine: coin slot 1's mechanical counter, a solenoid
 * the timer's period gives its on-time; each owed coin becomes a separate on-then-off pulse, so two
 * quick coins give two distinct clicks (mechanisms.md). The coin path bumps COIN_ACCEPTED 0xA981 [seen] once per coin; this
 * routine pays that debt off one pulse at a time. Its twin for the second slot, pulseSlot2CoinCounter
 * (0x49D6), is byte-identical but for three operands. mechanisms.md notes that the shared crediting
 * tail (awardCoinCreditThenPulseCoinCounter) ends by falling into THIS slot's driver whichever input
 * the credit came from, so on a frame that completes a credit this driver runs twice.
