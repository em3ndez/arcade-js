/** paintSuppressedDigit — paint one four-bit digit into the cell the cursor names, lay the caller's colour
 * beside it in the plane below, and leave the cursor snapped onto the character side.
 *
 * A digit only reaches the glyph table through an index, and the index is where the suppression
 * lives: a non-zero digit indexes by its own value AND steps a flag on, while a zero indexes
 * either the blank entry or entry zero depending on whether that flag is still clear. So the
 * flag separates the zeros ahead of the first significant digit from the zeros after it, and it
 * is the caller who owns the flag across a run of these. Which entry the blank is is not an
 * immediate here either; it is fetched from a byte of the program image.
 *
 * ROM 0x0DAF-0x0DCB (frozen lift translated/loc_0daf.js). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x0DAF).
 *
 * Role in the machine: the digit painter of the score readouts. Its caller is
 * paintTwoSuppressedDigitsFromByte, which feeds it the two nibbles of a packed-decimal byte; the
 * six-digit score and high-score fields are built from those pairs. A suppressed zero is painted as
 * a BLANK, so the field keeps its width — names.js records a MAME tap on which a value of ten
 * thousand read blank, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0. That is the difference from its twin
 * paintDigitDroppingLeadingZero, which drops a suppressed zero and takes no cell for it.
 *
 * The screen: the character plane (glyphs, based at 0xA400) and the colour plane (based at 0xA000)
 * hold the same grid at the same offsets, told apart only by address bit 10 (0x0400).
 *
 * Parameters (named after their ROM registers): `a` the digit in its low nibble; `b` the caller's
 * "significant digit seen" flag (0 = none yet); `c` the colour byte; `hl` the caller's pointer,
 * saved and restored by the ROM around the lookup; `de` the character-plane cell to paint.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: the two cells painted, the flag, the cursor, and the colour. */
