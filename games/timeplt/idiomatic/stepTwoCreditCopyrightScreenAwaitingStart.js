/** stepTwoCreditCopyrightScreenAwaitingStart — the copyright screen's await-start step: redraw the fixed caption, flash its line,
 * then dispatch on the start buttons — bit 4 (two-player, tested first) or bit 3 (one-player), and
 * with neither held return. LIVE-OUT: what the chosen start leaves, else memory only.
 *
 * ROM 0x188A-0x189D. Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x188a).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. This is step 4 of phase 2 of the attract/credit sequence machine — the
 * "a credit is on the board, waiting for start" phase (mechanisms.md, "Phase 2"). Its caller is
 * dispatchSequencePhase2SubStepArm, which runs one arm per frame. postAttractInfoCaptions (step 2)
 * steps straight to here when there are two or more credits; the one-credit wait
 * stepCopyrightScreenAwaitingStart (step 3) steps here when more credits arrive. So this arm runs
 * frame after frame, with at least two credits banked, until a start button is pressed.
 *
 * Nothing here advances the sequence step itself: with no button held it simply returns, and the
 * next frame the same arm runs again. Leaving the screen is entirely the job of the two start
 * routines, which (per names.js) send the sequence machine to its last phase.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: whatever startTwoPlayerGame / startOnePlayerGame leave when a start is taken (both are
 * tail calls in the ROM: `jp nz,0x189e` / `jp nz,0x3215`); otherwise memory only.
