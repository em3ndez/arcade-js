/**
 * advanceToNextSlot — step the record cursor and the parallel sprite-entry cursor on to the next
 * object slot.
 *
 * ROM 0x309B-0x30A4 (loc_309b). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x309B).
 *
 * What it is: objects are kept in numbered slots, and each slot owns TWO things in two parallel
 * tables — a sixteen-byte record describing the object, and a two-byte sprite entry in a second table.
 * A walker over the slots holds one cursor into each table; because the two tables have
 * different strides, stepping to the next slot means adding a different amount to each cursor
 * so that both keep pointing at the SAME slot index.
 *
 * Role in the machine: the scenery routines use it — placeAbuttingTile to step onto a further tile
 * of the sprite it has just placed, driftOneTileSceneryAtThreeQuarters and driftOneTileSceneryAtHalf
 * to reach a different entity. The callers disagree about what the next slot holds, so the unit
 * this advances is the slot index, not the object.
 *
 * Nothing is read, written or clamped.
 *
 * Parameters: `record` — the cursor into the sixteen-byte records (IX in the ROM);
 *             `entry`  — the cursor into the two-byte sprite entries (IY in the ROM).
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: the two stepped cursors.
