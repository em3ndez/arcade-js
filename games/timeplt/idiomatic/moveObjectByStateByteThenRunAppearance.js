// ROLE IN THE MACHINE. Every object in play carries a state byte at the head of its record (0xFF live,
// 0xF0 just hit -- mechanisms.md §6). Once a kill has been counted the byte becomes a death countdown
// from 0x3B down, and stepDyingObjectState steps it; while it has not reached zero, that routine hands
// the frame's move to this entry. Per mechanisms.md §6, the wreck flies on at the slowest speed while
// the count is high and afterwards only drifts with the world, while the appearance step animates it
// off the same count.
//
// PARAMETERS. `object` is the object's record (the ROM's IX) and `sprite` its sprite entry (IY), both
// seated by the caller and passed on unchanged.
//
// LIVE-OUT: memory only -- the state byte (upper band only), the object's coordinates, and the shape
// and tint written by the appearance step.
