/** freeAndNumberEveryObjectSlot — lay out a run of twenty-three records, sixteen bytes apart from a fixed start:
 * each record's first byte is cleared and its sixteenth is stamped with that record's position
 * in the run, counting from one. Nothing is read, so the run comes out the same however it went
 * in, and the stamped byte is what tells one record from another. LIVE-OUT: memory, and the record
 * cursor the walk ends on -- one record past the run (the ROM leaves it in IX) -- returned.
 *
 * ROM 0x1AE4-0x1AFB (lift: translated/loc_1ae4.js). Grounding: [seen].
 *
 * Role in the machine: the game's moving objects each own a sixteen-byte record. The run from
 * ACTOR_RECORD_SLOT0 (0xA810) through 0xA970 is the actor band plus the scenery band — every slot
 * but the player's. Clearing +0 (the occupancy byte) frees every slot at once; the only caller is
 * the life-start routine resetPlayfieldAndArmNewRound, so this runs once per life, not per frame.
 *
 * Why stamp a number: the +0x0F byte is an IDENTITY other code selects by. When a timer expires,
 * countTheKillAndGrantTheSharedToken writes a record's own stamp (plus a top bit) into a shared
 * cell, and the code at 0x2C31 retires an object outright unless that cell's low seven bits match
 * its stamp. Under MAME the twenty-three stamps read 1 through 23 on every dispatch.
