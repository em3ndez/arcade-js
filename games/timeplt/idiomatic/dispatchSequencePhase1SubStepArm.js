/** dispatchSequencePhase1SubStepArm — inner level of the two-level sequence machine for one outer
 * mode: the sub-step index picks one arm from a fixed inline word table, that arm runs, then this
 * mode's shared tail. Each case is the slot's literal target, called directly. The index is RAW; the
 * entry doubling wraps at eight bits, so index and index+128 pick the same slot (low seven bits key
 * the switch). Thirteen slots are transcribed arms; a higher index addresses bytes that carry no
 * routine, so reaching one is a fault and it is raised, not assumed away. No arm reads a register the
 * dispatch would have left standing — each opens on a cell read or a fixed-argument call — so the arm
 * is entered directly, with no table word carried in on a register pair. LIVE-OUT: memory, and the
 * shared tail's. */

/*
 * ROM 0x1651-0x1658 (dispatch) + 0x1659 (the inline word table PHASE1_SUBSTEP_DISPATCH_TABLE),
 * shared tail 0x167B; grounding [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x1651).
 *
 * ROLE. The game is driven by a two-level sequence machine: the outer phase SEQUENCE_PHASE (0 boot
 * wipe, 1 attract sequence, 2 credit / push-start, 3 round engine) picks a per-phase dispatcher, and
 * the inner index SEQUENCE_SUBSTEP (0xA9AC, [seen]) picks one "arm" -- one step of that phase -- from
 * the dispatcher's table. This is the phase-1 dispatcher: the attract sequence, which runs the pen
 * route animation, the credit line and the copyright screen, interleaved with the image-tamper
 * checks, then starts the attract demo.
 *
 * MECHANISM IN THE ROM. `ld hl,0x167b / push hl` plants the shared tail's address as the return
 * address, `ld a,(0xa9ac)` loads the index unmasked, and RST 0x30 (the computed-jump helper) jumps to
 * the table word at 0x1659 + 2*index. The arm's closing `ret` therefore lands on the tail,
 * advanceSequenceElseStartFreePlayGame (0x167B): with credits in the machine it steps the outer phase
 * on (leaving attract for the push-start phase); otherwise, only with free play set and a start
 * button held, it starts a game charging no credit. Here the
 * switch calls the arm and then runs the tail explicitly.
