/**
 * startTwoPlayerGame — ROM 0x189E [seen]
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. The two-player start: it stocks the machine for a game with BOTH players' contexts
 * filled in and charges two credits for it. Its callers are stepTwoCreditCopyrightScreenAwaitingStart
 * and stepHighScoreInitialsEntry.
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. In ROM order: park the copyright caption's sprites (hideCaptionSprites
 * 0x0B2B [seen]); raise PLAY_ACTIVE (0xAD30 [seen]) and TWO_PLAYER_GAME (0xAD31 [seen]) to all ones
 * -- the second is what later draws the 2-UP readout; load PLAYER_ONE_LIVES (0xAD10) and
 * PLAYER_TWO_LIVES (0xAD20) from STARTING_LIVES (0xA9C1, lives per game); run the two-player-start
 * arm (setUpTwoPlayerStartObjectOnce, 0x460E [seen]); take two off the packed-decimal CREDIT_COUNT
 * (0xA986) and repaint the credit panel; and send the sequence machine to its last outer phase, the
 * round engine (0x172A, a tail jump). It is startOnePlayerGame's charge with 2 in place of 1
 * (names.js), though unlike it this entry does not copy the three tilemap cells.
 * LIVE-OUT: memory only.
