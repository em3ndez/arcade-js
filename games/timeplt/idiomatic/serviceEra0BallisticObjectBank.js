/** serviceEra0BallisticObjectBank — in era zero only, run one frame of the three-slot ballistic-object bank from the top:
 * start the cursors at the first slot, then step an empty first slot, fly a ballistic (0xFF) first slot
 * before stepping it, or hand any other first-slot marker to the servicing sweep; outside era zero do
 * nothing. LIVE-OUT: memory; in era zero, returns where the bank's cursors stopped
 * ({ record, sprite, count }). */

/*
 * ROM 0x3FEA-0x4007, grounding [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x3fea).
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. The era-object bank is three 16-byte records from ERA_OBJECT_RECORD_SLOT0 (0xA8C0,
 * [seen]) paired with two-byte sprite entries from ERA_OBJECT_ENTRY_SLOT0 (0xAA28, [seen]). Each era
 * runs it through its own entry; this is the era-0 one, run from the round engine's
 * service list (serviceRoundThenResolvePlayerState). In era 0 a slot marked 0xFF flies a ballistic
 * arc -- a constant sideways step plus a velocity on the other axis that grows every frame -- which
 * fits gameplay.md's note that the 1910 bombs fall on a parabola.
 *
 * MECHANISM. The bank is walked by one loop with several entry points (0x4008, 0x400B among them):
 * this entry only seats the cursors and decides, from the FIRST slot's marker byte, which of those
 * entry points to join. The later slots are routed by the loop itself.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory; in era zero, the object the joined sweep returns (where the cursors stopped).
