/** requestPlayerShotSound — request one sound, admitted while a game runs or the cabinet may sound in attract.
 * Its code is fetched from a byte of the program image. LIVE-OUT: memory.
 *
 * ROM 0x567E-0x5682 (`ld a,(0x3270)` then `jr 0x5617`). Grounding: [seen].
 *
 * Role in the machine: one of the many one-line "sound request" entries the game logic calls
 * when something audible happens -- here, the player's shot. It does not play anything itself:
 * it hands a sound-command code to the shared sound queue, which the main CPU later drains to
 * the sound-data latch for the second (audio) Z80 to act on.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory only -- the sound queue (its count and the slot the new count selects), and
 * only when the permission lets the request through. */
