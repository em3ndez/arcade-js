/**
 * paintDeferredCells — paint a list of pending cell edits into the character plane and its colour plane.
 * The list is four-byte entries (colour-plane address, shape, colour); the pending count is the low half of
 * the list's own write cursor, so the whole list lives in one page and every cursor step wraps inside it. A
 * cursor still at the first entry means nothing is pending and it leaves at once. An entry whose colour cell
 * already has its high-priority bit set is passed over (a cell drawn above the sprites is never repainted
 * here); every other entry has its shape written to the character plane and its colour written back at the
 * address, with one shared bias added first, so the whole list re-tints together. LIVE-OUT: memory-only.
 *
 * ROM: 0x52D2. Tag [seen] (names.js). Role in the machine: the middle step of
 * drainBothDeferredCellLists, run at vertical blank. The player's shots are not hardware sprites;
 * queueTileStampForObject turns each shot into a two-by-two block of character cells and appends one entry
 * per cell to the list behind DEFERRED_WRITE_CURSOR 0xAE00 [seen], entries starting at DEFERRED_WRITE_LIST
 * 0xAE04 [seen]. This routine is where those queued cells actually reach the screen; the step before it
 * blanks last pass's cells, and the step after copies this list onto the blank list for the next pass.
