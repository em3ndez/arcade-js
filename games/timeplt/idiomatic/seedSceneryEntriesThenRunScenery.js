 * seedSceneryEntriesThenRunScenery — ROM 0x3117 [seen]
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. The below-era-4 half of scenery set-up. clearSceneryEntriesThenRunEraScenery clears
 * eight scenery sprite cells and, for eras 0-3, continues here; this seeds the first eight scenery
 * sprite slots from a four-row ROM table and then hands on to the frame's scenery run
 * (runSceneryForEra, 0x2CBC [seen]) with a tail jump.
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. The seeding is guarded by an anti-tamper check. TAMPER_WITNESS (0xAD39
 * [seen]) is a glyph/colour pair the attract screen seeds with 0x68 and 0x05; this routine goes on
 * only when it reads 0x68 and the next cell 0x10 or 0x05. Under MAME the check always passes. On a
 * mismatch the ROM jumps (via trampolineToLoc_307f, 0x3114 [code]) into bytes at 0x307F that are
 * really caption data, the "READY" record, decoded as code (mechanisms.md, anti-tamper), instead
 * of seeding the scenery.
 *
 * Each table row (SCENERY_SEED_TABLE 0x316E) is a packed byte pair that fills TWO sprite slots, at
 * the entry cursor and two bytes on: the first byte goes to +0x31 of the first slot and, plus 0x10,
 * to +0x31 of the second; the second byte goes to +0x00 of both. names.js calls the pair
 * (tint, shape) and the constants below keep that vocabulary; mechanisms.md records that +0x31 and
 * +0x00 are where a sprite entry keeps its two coordinates, so these are really starting
 * positions, and the names are due for re-derivation.
 *
 * PARAMETERS (all from the caller, and read only by the divert arm): `era` (the ROM's C),
 * `entryCursor` (IY), `clearStride` (E), `clearCount` (B, the caller's clear loop's spent count) and
 * `recordCursor` (IX, which the placed tile's closing step advances with the entry cursor).
 * On the seat arm every register the body touches is dead-after-return scratch -- the scenery run
 * reseats both cursors before reading either -- so it lives here as JS locals. The divert arm is
 * different: the lifted destination stores the caller's clear stride through the walked pointer,
 * folds the byte under it, counts the caller's spent clear count down (wrapping, so it keeps to its
 * one-tile arm) and places one tile through the caller's entry cursor offset by the era -- so the
 * pointer, the byte, the era, the cursors, the stride and the count are all handed across.
 * LIVE-OUT: memory.
