/** requestEraKeyedLaunchSound — ask for one of two sounds, picked by how far the era cell has climbed:
 * with ERA_INDEX below 3 (the first three eras) one request goes out, from index 3 (the fourth era)
 * on the other does. Choosing between them is the whole content of this entry — it writes nothing
 * itself and passes nothing on, so both requests carry the code and the permission they carry
 * anywhere. LIVE-OUT: memory, through the request.
 *
 * ROM 0x3F93-0x3F9D. Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x3f93).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. Its one caller, launchBankEnemyWhenAimedNearPlayer, has just found a free
 * slot and written a fresh record, so this request is one-to-one with an object appearing: it is
 * the sound of a craft launching. Both arms go through the play-gated sound door
 * (enqueueSoundIfGameInProgress), so the attract demo stays silent.
