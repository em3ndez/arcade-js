/** floodColourPlaneWithSavedPlayerColour — flood the playfield's colour plane with one byte, then hand the sequence its next
 * step. The byte comes from one of two parallel cells, picked by a selector that says which of
 * two players is up. The area covered is a rectangle inset from the plane's edges, painted a row
 * at a time; when the picture is turned round the painting runs from the far corner backwards
 * instead, which changes the ORDER cells are touched in and not WHICH, so the two directions
 * leave the plane identical. A separate countdown is stepped down by one on the way out.
 * LIVE-OUT: memory only.
 *
 * ROM 0x13CC-0x1429 (lift: translated/loc_13cc.js). Grounding: [seen].
 *
 * Role in the machine: after a round is won the game plays a between-eras band animation
 * (sub-step 14 of the round engine, stepRoundStartIntroAnimation), stepped by
 * INTRO_ANIMATION_STEP (0xA9F0). This is its step-4 arm: it sets the step to 5, whose arm winds the
 * animation up, and washes the playfield's colour plane with the active player's saved pen colour.
 * The colour is the SAVED copy from the per-player save block (PLAYER_ONE_PEN_COLOUR 0xAD1C or
 * PLAYER_TWO_PEN_COLOUR 0xAD2C, chosen by ACTIVE_PLAYER 0xAD32), not the live PEN_COLOUR.
