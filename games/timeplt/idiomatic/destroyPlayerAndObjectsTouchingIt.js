/** destroyPlayerAndObjectsTouchingIt — run one moving thing against a caller-supplied list of targets and destroy the ones
 * it has reached. The mover must still be live before anything is tested, so nothing happens once
 * it has already been spent. Each live target is then tested on both axes against the SAME window
 * width, which the caller supplies along with its slack, and a target inside both is marked
 * destroyed together with the mover — but the sweep runs on, so one pass can mark several.
 * How many targets there are is the caller's too, and it is the bottom of the loop that ends the
 * sweep: a count of zero walks the whole 256, which is what the count register means rather than
 * a special case. The two cursors advance differently: the occupancy cursor steps the LOW half of
 * its address only, so it wraps inside its own page, while the coordinate cursor steps whole.
 * Both are handed back where the sweep left them, one past the last target — and NOT advanced at
 * all when the mover was already spent, since that path never enters the sweep.
 * LIVE-OUT: memory, plus the two cursors (occupancy in E, coordinate in IY).
 *
 * THREADING RETURN (added for C2 de-register work): also returns the cursor pair as a tuple
 * { occupancy, entry } so a caller can thread it forward without reading regs.e/regs.iy back. The
 * register writes above are unchanged and remain the DECLARED live-out; on the spent-mover early
 * exit neither register is written (contract preserved) and the tuple echoes the un-advanced input
 * cursors. Both tuple fields are u16-wrapped at the boundary. */
