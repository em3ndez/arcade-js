 * startOnePlayerGame — ROM 0x3215 [seen]
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. The charged one-player start: it stocks the machine for a game with only
 * the FIRST player's context filled in and charges one credit for it. Its callers are the
 * push-start screens (stepCopyrightScreenAwaitingStart, stepTwoCreditCopyrightScreenAwaitingStart)
 * and stepHighScoreInitialsEntry.
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. In ROM order: park the copyright caption's sprites (hideCaptionSprites
 * 0x0B2B [seen]); clear TWO_PLAYER_GAME (0xAD31 [seen], the byte beside PLAY_ACTIVE) and
 * PLAYER_TWO_LIVES (0xAD20), which is what makes a hand-over to a second player impossible later;
 * raise PLAY_ACTIVE (0xAD30 [seen]) to all ones, the flag that separates real play from the attract
 * demo; load PLAYER_ONE_LIVES (0xAD10) from STARTING_LIVES (0xA9C1, the DSW-configured lives per
 * game); take one off the packed-decimal CREDIT_COUNT (0xA986) and repaint the credit panel; copy
 * three tilemap cells into their keeps; and send the sequence machine to its last outer phase, the
 * round engine (0x172A, a tail jump).
 *
 * names.js records that the charge is the ONLY difference from startGameOnFreePlay's one-player arm
 * at 0x1719: the same seven stores in the same order, both ending at 0x172A. This entry alone puts
 * the credit subtract and repaint between them. The store order itself carries no meaning.
 * LIVE-OUT: memory only.
