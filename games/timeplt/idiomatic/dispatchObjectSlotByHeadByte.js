/** dispatchObjectSlotByHeadByte — split three ways on the head byte of the record the index register points at. Zero
 * is an exit with nothing done; all-ones and every other non-zero value each hand over to their
 * own continuation. That split is the whole of the routine: one byte read, nothing written, and
 * neither continuation is given anything this entry computed. LIVE-OUT: whatever it hands over to.
 *
 * ROM 0x3E63-0x3E6B (frozen lift translated/loc_3e63.js). Grounding: [seen] in names.js.
 *
 * Role in the machine: a per-slot handler in an object sweep. An object record's head byte is its
 * state (names.js, the enemy-craft slot note: 0x00 free, 0xFF live, other values a count), so the
 * split is: free slot -> nothing to do; live -> fly it (flyAndRetireSlotCyclingShapeInEra4, 0x3E6C,
 * which the ROM simply falls into); any other value -> the slot is running a count
 * (runSlotCountdownDriftAndAnimateElseRetire, 0x3E8E, a tail jump).
 *
 * Parameters: `ix` the object's record and `iy` its sprite entry, as the sweep seats them; both are
 * passed through untouched. */
