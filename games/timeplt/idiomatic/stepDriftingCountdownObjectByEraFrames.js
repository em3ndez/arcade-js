/** stepDriftingCountdownObjectByEraFrames — run one frame of an object whose life is a countdown at its base. At or above the
 * reset mark the state is re-stamped and its sound requested; then the object drifts with the
 * world and the count falls by one. At zero the slot retires. Below the animation window nothing
 * more happens; otherwise the count picks a frame from one of two fixed tables — the choice made
 * on the era index — and that frame plus a fixed sprite state are written to the sprite entry.
 * The object record and its sprite entry are arguments. LIVE-OUT: memory.
 *
 * ROM 0x413C-0x4182 (frozen lift translated/loc_413c.js). Grounding: [seen] in names.js.
 *
 * The object's record head (+0x00) doubles as its lifetime counter: the object lives exactly as long
 * as that byte is counting down. Its paired sprite entry follows the usual Time Pilot entry layout
 * (names.js, the enemy-craft slot note): +0x01 = tile/shape, +0x30 = attribute (colour + flip).
 *
 * Parameters: `ix` is the object's record (the caller's object sweep seats it), `iy` is the sprite
 * entry paired with that record. Both default to the caller's IX/IY. */
