/** showCreditLine — one sequence step that refreshes the panel and caption, then reads a guard byte that is

 * sequence's inner index; otherwise it repaints the panel from its packed-decimal count, queues one caption request,
 * then the guard decides. Zero stamps the caption strip, requests the caption line in this frame's colour, and folds
 * a twenty-byte image run into the tamper total. Nonzero has no routine to run, so it RAISES rather than guessing.

// ROM 0x2D3F-0x2D61, ending in `jp 0x43e8` (sumImageBlockForTheTamperCheck); lift:
// translated/loc_2d3f.js. Grounding tag in names.js ROUTINES: [seen].
//
// ROLE IN THE MACHINE. The game's screens are run by a two-level sequence machine (outer phase,
// inner sub-step); each sub-step is an "arm" like this one, called once per frame, that either
// returns (to be run again next frame) or moves the inner index on. This arm puts the CREDIT line up:
// record 8 of the caption table at 0x0C50 is the glyph run that the tile ROM draws as C R E D I T,
// and the number beside it is CREDIT_COUNT (0xA986), the packed-decimal credit count the one- and
// two-player starts take credits off. On free play there are no credits to show, so the arm does
// nothing but step on.
//
// It is also one link of the ANTI-TAMPER chain: its tail sums a run of the program image (the
// copyright caption record) and hands the total on -- sumImageBlockForTheTamperCheck ->
// parkTheImageTotalForTheTamperVerdict -> advanceSequenceUnlessImageTampered, which compares it with
// a baked-in constant and steps the sequence on only on a match; a mismatch goes to its tamper arm.
//
// LIVE-OUT: memory only -- the credit panel, the caption request ring, the copyright strip and its
// line request, and whatever the tamper chain leaves (on a genuine image, the sequence stepped on).
