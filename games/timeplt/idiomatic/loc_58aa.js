 * loc_58aa — fly one object a double step at the pace one fixed table of velocity samples sets.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS: ROM 0x58AA-0x58AF, tag [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x58aa). The whole ROM routine is
 * `ld hl,0x59d7 / jp 0x58fe`: it fixes the table at 0x59D7 and hands over to the double-velocity mover,
 * flyAlongHeadingAtDoubleVelocity. Choosing the table and the mover is the whole of this entry, and a
 * pointer the caller held (the ROM's HL) is discarded.
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE: the era-4 arm steerEnemyTowardShip alternates, on bit 1 of the frame tick,
 * between this entry and flyAtSecondFastestSpeed (names.js 0x5860), so the object does not stay on one
 * rung. The table is the bottom rung of the ladder (206), but the mover doubles the object's own
 * velocity, so this entry moves farther per step than flyAtSecondFastestSpeed's single 306 (names.js
 * "why" for 0x5860).
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory (the object's coordinates, written by the mover).
