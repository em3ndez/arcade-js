/** stepHighScoreInitialsEntry — one frame of high-score initials entry. On even frames the facing panel's four
 * controls are rolled into their press histories; a fresh commit locks the shown letter into the
 * next slot (and, on the last slot, finishes the entry), a fresh forward/back press steps the
 * shown letter round its 27-value ring, and a history that has saturated is emptied so a held
 * control repeats. On odd frames the cursor cell's colour flashes. Every eighth frame the entry
 * clock ticks, and running out finishes the entry too. Finishing re-arms the clock, queues the
 * transition sounds and steps the sequence on. After the scan, once neither player has lives
 * left, a held start button with a credit (or on free play) starts the next game.
 * LIVE-OUT: memory only; the accumulator and flags left behind are dead at the one caller. */

// ROM 0x18C3-0x19D9; lift: translated/loc_18c3.js. Grounding tag in names.js ROUTINES: [seen].
//
// ROLE IN THE MACHINE. After a game over the phase-3 sub-step table runs a short run of arms: arm 8
// (fileScoreAfterGameOverHoldElsePassTurn) files the score into the high-score table, arm 9
// (erasePenRouteThenOpenInitialsEntry) lays out the entry screen and seeds every cell this routine
// steps -- three slots left, letter 0, empty press histories -- and parks two cursors: SCRATCH_PTR_A
// (0xA991) [seen] at the filed record's initials bytes in the high-score table, SCRATCH_PTR_B (0xA993)
// [seen] at the on-screen cell where the next initial is drawn. This is arm 10, run every frame
// until the entry finishes, when it steps the sequence sub-step on.
//
// HOW A CONTROL IS READ. Each control is debounced by a PRESS HISTORY: a byte its bit is rolled into
// on every other frame, newest sample in bit 0. The owner acts only when the low three bits read 001
// -- "not pressed, not pressed, pressed" -- i.e. once, on the leading edge of a press. A held control
// fills the byte with ones and 001 cannot recur; so once the byte saturates it is emptied
// (rearmHeldControlRepeat, 0x1980 [seen]), the next sample then reads as a fresh press, and a held
// control auto-repeats.
//
// THE SCREEN. Video RAM has two planes 0x400 apart: a cell's glyph at the tile-plane address and its
// colour at the same address with bit 10 (0x400) clear, which is how every colour write below is
// addressed (`cursor & ~COLOUR_PLANE_BIT`).
//
// LIVE-OUT: memory only -- the initials glyphs in the table record and on screen, their colours, the
// entry cells (histories, letter index, slots left, flash timer), SEQUENCE_DELAY, the two scratch
// pointers, and on a finish or a new-game start whatever those routines set up.
