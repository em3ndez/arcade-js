 * seatSceneryFillByte0x28ThenClearEraScenery — fix the scenery fill byte at 0x28, then clear and run
 * the era scenery.
 *
 * ROM 0x3156-0x315A (`ld a,0x28 / jp 0x30D1`). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x3156).
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. A two-instruction entry into the scenery clear-and-run body at ROM 0x30D1
 * (clearSceneryEntriesThenRunEraScenery). That body clears a stride-two run of eight object cells to
 * the fill byte carried in A and then seats and runs the frame's scenery for the era. This entry
 * fixes that byte at 0x28 (decimal 40), and choosing that one
 * constant is its entire content -- whatever fill byte the caller carried is discarded.
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. Reached from seatEraSceneryRowThenClearAndRunScenery on its era-four path.
 * Control transfers to the body and does not come back here.
 *
 * PARAMETERS. `era` is the era the caller carried (the body branches on it), `entryCursor` the
 * sprite-entry cursor it carried; both pass straight through.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory.
