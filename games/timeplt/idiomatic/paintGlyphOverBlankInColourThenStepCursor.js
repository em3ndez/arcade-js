/** paintGlyphOverBlankInColourThenStepCursor — lay a two-cell piece into the character plane at the cursor, then step the cursor
 * one place along the line. The cell the cursor names takes the caller's glyph; the address one
 * BELOW it takes the blanking glyph; and both take the caller's colour in the plane beside them.
 * Coming back from the colour plane is a SET, so the cursor is left on the glyph side whether or
 * not it arrived there, and one arriving on the colour side writes its glyph there instead. The
 * pointer the caller was holding is untouched.
 * The cursor is then stepped one cell on along the line (advanceCharCursor).
 *
 * ROM 0x4DCF-0x4DDD (frozen lift translated/loc_4dcf.js). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x4DCF).
 *
 * Role in the machine: one column of the two-cell slot that stampTwoByTwoTileBlock writes, with the
 * other cell of the slot blanked. Its one call site is the loop at 0x4D9A in
 * drawEmblemStripThenGuardImage (ring command 5, the reserve-ships HUD): after the emblems it clears
 * the rest of the row, from 0xA783 down to 0xA623, passing the blank glyph 0xF1 as the glyph — so
 * there BOTH cells come out blank. names.js records a MAME write tap of 126 dispatches, each a pair
 * one cell apart with the blank on the lower address.
 *
 * The screen: the character plane (glyphs, based at 0xA400) and the colour plane (based at 0xA000)
 * hold the same grid at the same offsets, told apart only by address bit 10 (0x0400).
 *
 * Parameters (and their ROM registers): `cursor` the character-plane cell (DE — the ROM swaps it
 * into HL for the writes and back, which is why the caller's HL survives); `glyph` the glyph for
 * the cursor's cell (B); `colour` the colour for both cells (C).
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: the four cells written and the stepped cursor, returned. */
