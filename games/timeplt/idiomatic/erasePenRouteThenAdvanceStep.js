/** erasePenRouteThenAdvanceStep — attract-sequence arm (phase 1, sub-step 0): fold a fixed 256-byte program run into an
 * eight-bit total and derail into the checksum-failure landing on any total but the genuine one;
 * otherwise set the pen colour and stamp glyph (to blank), arm the pen to its route start, and step
 * the sequence sub-step -- twice when the pen colour already held its set value. LIVE-OUT: memory.
 *
 * ROM 0x074B-0x0773 (frozen lift loc_074b). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x074B).
 *
 * Role in the machine: the game's top level is a two-level sequence machine — an outer phase and
 * an inner sub-step (SEQUENCE_SUBSTEP 0xA9AC [seen]) that picks which arm runs this frame. This
 * is the first arm of attract phase 1, reached through dispatchSequencePhase1SubStepArm. The
 * attract screens use a "pen" that draws a fixed route leg by leg, stamping PEN_GLYPH and
 * PEN_COLOUR into each character cell it passes (plotPenCell). Setting the glyph to the blank
 * 0xF1 turns that pen into an eraser: this arm prepares it, and sub-step 1
 * (advancePenRunAnimationStep) then erases the route one leg per frame (mechanisms.md, phase 1).
 *
 * Anti-tamper: like many arms in this ROM, it first sums a block of the program image and refuses
 * to continue on a modified image. The failure path does not report an error — it jumps into
 * loc_08fa [code], a landing whose bytes are really a data table and which, run as code, always
 * faults (names.js). On a genuine image the check does nothing.
