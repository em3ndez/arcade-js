/** startTheWholePlaneWipeAndFoldAnImageBlockIntoThePhase — run one setup-and-guard entry, seat the inner sequence index at a fixed step, then fold a
 * block of the program image into the outer phase. Neither number lands as an immediate: the index is READ
 * from a program byte that is the low half of an address inside an instruction, so moving that instruction
 * moves the index, and the phase is not assigned at all — a 256-byte block is subtracted from whatever it
 * already holds and a fixed key exclusive-ored into the difference. That leaves some phases standing and
 * moves others, so it is a tamper test that CORRUPTS the sequence rather than refusing to run. LIVE-OUT: memory.
 *
 * ROM 0x15E2-0x15FD. Grounding: [seen].
 *
 * Role in the machine: the game is driven by a two-level sequence machine -- an OUTER phase
 * (SEQUENCE_PHASE, 0xA9AB: 0 boot wipe, 1 attract, 2 credit / push-start, 3 round engine) and
 * an INNER sub-step index (SEQUENCE_SUBSTEP, 0xA9AC). The vblank frame service masks the phase
 * to two bits and dispatches through its phase table at 0x015F; phase 0 goes to 0x15C2, which
 * masks the sub-step with 0x07 and dispatches through the inline word table at 0x15C8. Entry 0
 * of that table is this routine: the first thing phase zero does. Only entries 0 and 6 of that
 * table are arms; the bytes from 0x15D6 are caption record 5, ending just before this entry.
 *
 * Note that the dispatch masks the phase with 0x03, so arriving here proves only that the phase
 * is a multiple of four; 0x04, 0x08 and 0x0C are not fixed points of the fold below. That the
 * phase is left standing rests on SEQUENCE_PHASE's recorded range of four values (names.js).
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory -- the wipe cells armed by the call, SEQUENCE_SUBSTEP, SEQUENCE_PHASE. */
