/** fileScoreIntoHighScoreTable — try to file the active player's finished score into the five-entry high-score board.
 * The standing records are read top (highest) first; the new score is compared against each until
 * the first one it is NOT below, which is where it belongs. The records beneath that slot slide
 * down one place, the new score is written into the freed slot with its three name cells set to a
 * blank sentinel, the record's initial-glyph row pointer is looked up from the byte the copy
 * uncovered, and the rank column is renumbered top to bottom. A score that beats none is dropped.
 *
 * ROM 0x4CC3-0x4D2A (frozen lift translated/loc_4cc3.js). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x4cc3).
 *
 * Role in the machine: the insertion step of the high-score board, run once per finished game.
 * Its caller, fileScoreAfterGameOverHoldElsePassTurn, runs it when the GAME OVER hold expires and
 * branches on the carry this leaves: a filed score goes on to initials entry, a dropped one skips
 * it. The table is five records of eight bytes at 0xAB08..0xAB2F (HIGH_SCORE_TABLE_BASE ..
 * HIGH_SCORE_TABLE_END), each record laid out +0 rank, +1..+3 score lo/mid/hi, +4..+7 name glyphs;
 * scores are three packed-BCD bytes compared from the most significant end (isScoreBelow).
 *
 * The two saved pointers are what initials entry works through afterwards: SCRATCH_PTR_A is left
 * on the filed record's name cells, SCRATCH_PTR_B on that rank's initials row in the character
 * plane (HIGH_SCORE_INITIALS_CELL_BASE + 2 * rank).
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: the board, the two saved pointers, and carry — clear when filed, set when dropped. */
