/**
 * seedGameConfigFromDipSwitches — seed the settings block at power-on: two defaults from the program
 * image, then the two DIP-switch banks, handed on to the routines that unpack them.
 *
 * ROM 0x52AA-0x52D1 (ends `jp 0x2E19`). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x52AA).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. One link of the power-on chain (each routine jumps into the next; none
 * returns). Work RAM has just been cleared, so every setting is still zero; this is where the
 * operator's switch choices and two fixed defaults first reach RAM. It runs once per boot, so the
 * settings cells it fills are fixed until the next power-on (the frame service separately mirrors the
 * gameplay bank every frame into DIP1_MIRROR [code]; that is a different cell).
 *
 * THE SWITCHES. Both banks read active-low (a switch that is ON reads 0), so every read is
 * complemented before use. DSW0_PORT (0xC360) is the coinage bank; DSW1_PORT (0xC200, the read side
 * of the watchdog address) is the gameplay bank.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: HIGH_SCORE_HI, KILL_QUOTA, COINAGE_SETTINGS, whatever unpackCoinage leaves, and the whole
 * of the chain that follows — control never comes back.
