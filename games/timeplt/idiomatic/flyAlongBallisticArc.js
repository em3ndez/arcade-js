/** flyAlongBallisticArc — move one object a frame's worth along both axes and retire it once it has left the
 * picture. Each coordinate is 16 bits stored split, the whole part in the sprite entry and the
 * fraction in the record. Across, the object takes a fixed step whose direction is a byte of its
 * own record. Along the other axis it takes a step it does not hold constant: a second 16-bit
 * number in the record grows by a fixed amount every frame and is what gets added, so the object
 * accelerates. Both axes also take the frame's shared displacement, so the object moves with the
 * world on top of its own motion. The two whole parts are then tested against fixed limits — a
 * narrow wrapped window on the first axis, a floor on the second — and either one puts the slot
 * out of play.
 *
 * ROM 0x4017-0x406B (frozen lift translated/loc_4017.js). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x4017).
 *
 * Role in the machine: one of the per-era object movers, the one that throws an object on an arc.
 * names.js records that it is dispatched only while the first era is being played (its caller's
 * era gate), and that the spawner seeds the growing velocity pointing away from the direction it
 * then grows in, so the object first moves against the pull, stalls and comes back — a thrown
 * arc — while the sideways flag leans it toward the player. Leaving the field on either axis hands the slot to retireSlot.
 *
 * `record` is the object's record (IX on the Z80), `entry` its sprite entry (IY).
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory. */
