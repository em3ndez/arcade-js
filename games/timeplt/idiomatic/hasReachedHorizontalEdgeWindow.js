/** hasReachedHorizontalEdgeWindow — answer whether the byte at the head of the sprite entry a caller points at has arrived at the
 * wrap point. The test is a four-wide window that STRADDLES zero — the two values just short of the wrap and
 * the two from the wrap on — so it measures a wrapped distance and not a range, which is what lets a byte
 * stepping a few units at a time land inside it instead of over it. Nothing is written, and nothing here
 * establishes what the byte measures. LIVE-OUT: the answer, returned and mirrored into carry; memory untouched.
 *
 * ROM 0x3CE1-0x3CE8 (frozen lift translated/loc_3ce1.js): `ld a,(iy+0x00) / add a,0x02 / cp 0x04 / ret`.
 * Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x3ce1).
 *
 * Role in the machine: one of the family of "has this object left the field?" tests that mechanisms.md
 * lists under "Retire lines and edge tests". Objects are tested by their SCREEN position (the whole
 * bytes of their sprite entry), never their world position, because the world has no edge. This one is
 * the second half of hasReachedBoundaryBandSelectedByHeading (0x3CC4) and hasDriftedOffTheField: when
 * their band test on the entry's +0x31 byte fails, they hand on to this window on the entry's +0 byte,
 * so their carry is the OR of the two tests.
 *
 * Parameter: spriteEntry — the address of the sprite entry being tested; the ROM hands it in IY, and
 * only the entry's first byte (+0) is read.
