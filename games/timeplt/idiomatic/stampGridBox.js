/**
 * stampGridBox — stamp a block of four fixed character codes at the cursor: two into the pair of cells
 * the cursor names, and two into the pair one place further along the line, which is thirty-two
 * addresses on. The four codes are constants chosen here, so this reads nothing and lays down the
 * same block wherever it is pointed, and the cursor is left exactly where it was found.
 *
 * ROM 0x00C7-0x00D7 (frozen lift translated/loc_00c7.js). Grounding: [seen].
 *
 * Role in the machine: the four codes decode through the tile ROM as the corners of one hollow
 * box — top-left, top-right, and the two matching bottom halves — laid two cells across and two
 * rows down in the character plane. Its only caller is tileCharPlaneWithBoxLattice, which runs it
 * once per box across fourteen bands of sixteen to tile a power-on lattice over the plane; the
 * boot wipe erases that lattice before the attract sequence begins, so it is not a gameplay
 * background.
 *
 * `cursor` is the plane address of the box's first cell (the Z80 held it in HL, and saved and
 * restored it with push/pop so the caller's cursor survives the call).
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory, plus the step from the second cell to the third, left in an address pair.
