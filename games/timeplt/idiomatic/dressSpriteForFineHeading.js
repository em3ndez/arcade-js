/** dressSpriteForFineHeading — point an object's sprite entry the way the object is heading. The heading is a
 * point on a 256-step circle; rounded to the nearest of thirty-two equal sectors it selects a
 * two-byte entry of a table, whose first byte is the shape and whose second is the byte laid
 * beside it. Every other pair of frames the shape moves on by eight, so each sector alternates
 * between two shapes while the byte beside it does not change. Both go straight into the sprite
 * entry the caller's cursor names — this reads the object and writes the entry, and decides
 * nothing about either. LIVE-OUT: memory.
 *
 * ROM 0x2A97-0x2ABB (frozen lift translated/loc_2a97.js). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. serviceEra2EnemyCraftSlot, the craft handler of the third era, calls this
 * for each craft; under MAME it ran only on the tape that reaches that era (names.js). The entry's
 * shape byte is at +1 and its attribute byte (colour and flip) at +0x30, in the second of
 * the two parallel sprite runs (mechanisms.md). The table's second byte is a FLIP attribute, not a
 * per-sector palette: under MAME the writes took only 0x5C and 0xDC, one bit apart. The alternating
 * shape bank is driven by FRAME_TICK (0xA980), which advances by one every frame.
 *
 * Parameters: `entry` is the sprite entry (the ROM's IY) and `object` the object's record (IX).
