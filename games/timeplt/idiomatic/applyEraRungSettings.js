/**
 * applyEraRungSettings — ROM 0x1A9A [seen]
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. The difficulty loader. Time Pilot's play is shaped by the era (ERA_INDEX 0xAD04, the
 * manual's ROUND, 0-4) and by an escalation rung inside that era (ERA_RUNG 0xACC0) that climbs as the
 * round goes on. Each (era, rung) pair owns a ten-byte tuning row in ROM; this routine copies the
 * selected row into the work-RAM cells the spawners and launchers read.
 *
 * ROLE. Load a ten-byte row and scatter it over twelve fixed cells: two spawner caps, two aim
 * windows, two cooldown periods and their live countdowns, and two thresholds (names.js). Eight
 * bytes go to one cell each and two go to two cells each -- a cooldown PERIOD and the live
 * COUNTDOWN that the vblank service runs down and reloads from that period -- so applying a row also
 * restarts both countdowns at the new period. It is reached from the life-start routine (0x19F0, by
 * fall-through) as well as from the escalation timer, so round start applies the row too.
 * Under MAME, as the rung climbed, each destination took a monotone ladder of values.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory; nothing read back or returned.
