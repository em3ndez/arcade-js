/** hideAllSprites — sweep every sprite off the picture at once. Every slot the display
 * scans carries a vertical position, and this zeros all of them; zero puts a slot above the
 * FIRST drawn line, clear of the picture entirely, so nothing of it appears. Every other byte of a slot stands, so none is
 * retired. LIVE-OUT: memory only — 24 bytes, evenly spaced and all inside one page.
 *
 * ROM 0x15B6-0x15C1 (frozen lift translated/loc_15b6.js): `ld hl,0xaa41 / ld b,0x18 / xor a`, then
 * a `ld (hl),a / inc l / inc l / djnz` loop. Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x15b6).
 *
 * Role in the machine: the blunt "clear the stage" tool used between scenes (mechanisms.md: "Hiding is
 * a separate, cruder tool that ignores the records"). It works on the sprite-entry SHADOW, not on the
 * hardware banks: once per frame publishSpriteShadow copies the shadow into the two hardware sprite
 * banks, so zeroed shadow bytes become hidden sprites on the next publish. No object record is touched,
 * so an object's own state survives; it is simply not visible until something rewrites its Y byte.
 * Callers include the phase-2 step 0 (parkSpritesAndArmLineWipeThenAdvanceSequence), the free-play
 * start in advanceAttractTowardGameStart, loseLifeAndHandOver and the initials-entry screen.
 *
 * Its four-slot sibling hideCaptionSprites uses the identical idiom on the copyright caption's slots
 * alone -- one routine hiding a caption, this one hiding everything (names.js "why").
