/** drawKillMeter — repaint the meter that shows how many kills are still owed.
 *
 * The era selects a ten-byte row: the two glyphs the bar is built from, then eight end glyphs.
 * The low three bits of the count choose which end glyph, and the count divided by four — five
 * bits of that quotient — is how many bar cells are laid. Cells are laid from a fixed end of the
 * line with the two bar glyphs alternating, then the end glyph, then one blanking glyph, so the
 * bar shortens by a whole cell every four kills while the end glyph slides along with it and
 * covers the remainder. Only the glyph plane is written; nothing sets a colour, and nothing is
 * cleared beyond the single cell past the end glyph.
 * LIVE-OUT: memory only.
 *
 * ROM 0x0809-0x083D (frozen lift translated/loc_0809.js). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. KILLS_REMAINING (0xAD02) counts down the enemies still to destroy before
 * the Mother-Ship appears (56 at the start of every round), and the bar along the bottom of the
 * screen is a direct rendering of it (names.js) -- there is no time limit in this game; the bar is
 * this meter. It is repainted by postRoundStartCaptionsAndResetPlayfield at the start of a round
 * and also by serviceRoundThenResolvePlayerState.
 *
 * GEOMETRY. The bar starts at the fixed cell KILL_METER_BAR_START_CELL (0xA79F) and each further
 * cell is 32 addresses LOWER -- one row up in the native tilemap, which under the board's ROT90 is
 * one cell along a line on the glass.
