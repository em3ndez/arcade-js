/** initColdStartRamThenSeedConfig — cold-boot init: paint a 64-byte work-RAM block all-ones, then seed the random
 * register, load the default high scores and empty the deferred lists, kicking the watchdog after
 * each, and hand off to the settings/cold-start chain. Control never comes back.
 * LIVE-OUT: the painted block plus whatever the four callees leave; the chain's coroutine handoff.
 *
 * ROM 0x2511-0x252F. [seen]
 *
 * Role in the machine: the fourth stage of the cold start. Power-on (0x07B1) settled the control
 * latch, 0x0069 zeroed work RAM and the sprite banks, 0x5866 filled the screen and verified the
 * image, and it tail-jumps here. This stage puts the few structures that must NOT start at zero into
 * their empty/default state, then hands on to seedGameConfigFromDipSwitches (0x52AA), which reads the
 * DIP switches and carries the rest of the cold start.
