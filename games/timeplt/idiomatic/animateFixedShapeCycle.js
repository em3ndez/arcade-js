/**
 * animateFixedShapeCycle — give a sprite entry the current frame of an eight-frame shape cycle
 * from a fixed shape base, and one fixed control byte beside it.
 *
 * ROM 0x3E7E-0x3E8D (loc_3e7e). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x3E7E).
 *
 * What it is: the game never draws into the sprite hardware directly; handlers write a sprite
 * SHADOW (0xAA10-0xAA6F) that publishSpriteShadow copies to the two hardware sprite banks once a
 * frame. Each shadow entry keeps a coordinate at +0 and the sprite code (shape) at +1, and a second
 * table 0x30 bytes further on holds the attribute byte (colour and flip) at +0x30 and the other
 * coordinate at +0x31. This routine fills in the shape and the +0x30 byte of one entry.
 *
 * Why the shape is "fixed": the frame number comes only from FRAME_TICK (0xA980) [seen], the frame
 * counter the vertical-blank service advances once per frame. It is halved and taken modulo eight,
 * so the shape changes on every other frame and repeats forever through eight consecutive codes
 * from one base. Nothing about the object itself is read, so two entries written in the same tick
 * get the same shape.
 *
 * Role in the machine: its one caller reaches it as `call z` after comparing ERA_INDEX with 4, so
 * it only runs in the last era; under MAME read taps saw no dispatch in runs that stayed in eras
 * 0-3 and a steady stream in one holding era 4.
 *
 * Parameter: `entry` — the address of the sprite-shadow entry to dress (IY in the ROM).
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: the two bytes written; nothing is returned.
