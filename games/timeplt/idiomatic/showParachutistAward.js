/** showParachutistAward — put an object into a fixed state, ask for the sound that goes with it, and dress its
 * sprite entry for that state. The shape comes from a four-entry table in the program image chosen
 * by a byte of the object's own record; an index at or past the end of that table does NOT read on
 * past it — a single fixed shape is used instead, which is what keeps the lookup inside the table.
 * Either way the entry's second byte takes one fixed value. LIVE-OUT: memory.
 *
 * ROM 0x4809-0x482C. Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x4809).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. The parachutist is the figure the player collects for a bonus. Touching it
 * sets its state byte to 0xF0; on its next turn runParachutistSlot hands the slot here with the
 * record at PARACHUTIST_RECORD (0xA8F0) and its sprite entry. This starts the slot's exit: the
 * state is put at the top of the dying countdown and the parachutist's sprite is swapped for the
 * award glyph, chosen by the record's +7 byte, PARACHUTIST_RUNG 0xA8F7 -- how many rescue awards
 * this life has already paid. The first four rungs each show their own award glyph (ROM 0x482D
 * holds F9 FC 8D 8E); every later rung shows 0x8F. The count then runs down one per pass and the
 * score itself is posted later by postNextParachutistBonus (mechanisms.md).
