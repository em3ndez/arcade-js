 * runParachutistSlot — ROM 0x47B3 [seen]
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. The per-frame manager of the single parachutist -- the rescue object that drifts
 * across the sky and pays a bonus when the player's ship touches it (grounded under MAME as the
 * canopy + bonus object, removed by a negative control; names.js). Its state record is
 * PARACHUTIST_RECORD 0xA8F0 and its sprite entry PARACHUTIST_ENTRY 0xAA2E (both [seen]); the ROM
 * seats them in IX and IY. serviceRoundThenResolvePlayerState calls it once per round-engine pass.
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. The slot's state byte (record +0) is a small state machine:
 *   0x00       free -- hand to the spawner, which places it at the field edge ahead;
 *   0xFF       in flight -- fly it along its stored velocity, retire it on a retire line, else
 *              step its flight shape;
 *   0x10       post the next bonus rung;
 *   0x3C..0xFE show the award (the pickup mark written by the collision pass is 0xF0);
 *   anything else a countdown, drifting with the world, retired when it reaches zero.
 * In era 4 there is no parachutist at all, and the routine returns at once.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory.
