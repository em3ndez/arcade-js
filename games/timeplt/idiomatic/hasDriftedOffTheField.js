/** hasDriftedOffTheField — answer whether one of an object's two sprite-entry coordinates has arrived in a
 * three-wide band that sits a little short of the wrap, and when it has NOT, hand the question on
 * to the same test taken on the other coordinate. So the answer is an OR of two windows on two
 * axes, and only the first of them is decided here. Nothing is written.
 *
 * ROM 0x3CD9-0x3CE8 (frozen lift translated/loc_3cd9.js). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x3cd9).
 *
 * Role in the machine: one arm of the heading-keyed boundary test at 0x3CC4, whose `jp nz,0x3cd9` is
 * its only inbound transfer; the two callers of that test, 0x3B77 and 0x4447, free an object's slot on
 * a yes (names.js). The byte tested here is the entry's +0x31 coordinate; the other half of the
 * OR is hasReachedHorizontalEdgeWindow on the entry's +0x00 byte, reached as a fall-through.
 * `spriteEntry` is the object's sprite entry (IY on the Z80).
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: the answer, returned. */
