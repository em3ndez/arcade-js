 * erasePenRouteThenOpenInitialsEntry — sequence arm 9: erase the pen route, then open the high-score
 * initials entry.
 *
 * ROM 0x08B4. Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x08b4).
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. After a game ends with a score good enough for the table, the game's "pen" (which
 * stamps one glyph per character cell, run by run, along a route of target cells) is in use on
 * screen. The previous arm (arm 8,
 * fileScoreAfterGameOverHoldElsePassTurn) switched the pen to the blanking glyph 0xF1 and restarted
 * the route, so re-running the route now ERASES it. Once the erase finishes, this arm lays out the
 * initials-entry screen and seats every cell the next arm (stepHighScoreInitialsEntry, arm 10) reads
 * as the player dials in three initials.
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. Entry 9 of the phase-3 sub-step table at 0x0F29; the sequence machine calls it
 * once per frame until it steps the sub-index on. Each call:
 *   1. runs one leg of the pen route and returns unless the route has reseated to row 0;
 *   2. checks a 256-byte block of the program image (anti-tamper, see below);
 *   3. posts the entry screen's captions and paints the five labelled readouts;
 *   4. clears the control press histories (0xA995-0xA998) and the letter index (0xA999), and sets
 *      INITIALS_SLOTS_LEFT (0xA99A) to 3;
 *   5. stamps letter 0's glyph at the cursor cell held in SCRATCH_PTR_B and saves that cell's colour
 *      into INITIALS_LOCKED_LETTER_COLOUR (0xA990), the colour committed letters are painted in;
 *   6. steps the sequence sub-index.
 *
 * The fold is an anti-tamper check. The block is program image, so on a genuine image it always folds to the
 * same byte and the mismatch arm is dead. On a tampered image the arm jumps into the vertical-blank service
 * from outside an interrupt, carrying this arm's live registers into that service's shadow-bank swap: a
 * derail, not a behaviour. There is no faithful transcription of it as a routine, so this arm raises where it
 * would derail instead.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory only.
