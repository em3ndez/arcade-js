/** flyDemoShipByScript — the demo pilot's auto-steer. A countdown byte carries a dwell in its low six bits and
 *  a two-bit turn command in its top two. Each pass ticks the dwell and keeps the byte; when it is
 *  spent (zero or one) the pass steps a script pointer, reloads from the next entry and looks again,
 *  so a run of spent entries is skipped at once. The surviving command nudges the heading one way,
 *  the other, or not at all, then hands off to the world-scroll mover. LIVE-OUT: memory. */

// ROLE IN THE MACHINE. In the attract demo nobody holds the joystick, yet the ship must fly about
// convincingly. dispatchPlayerFrameByState (0x1EDF) sends a live ship (state byte 0xFF) here while
// PLAY_ACTIVE (0xAD30) is clear, instead of reading the controls. The pilot follows a byte-coded
// script in ROM, chosen before the demo starts (mechanisms.md, "Flying"); each script byte says
// "for this many frames, turn this way" (or hold). When it turns, it moves the heading directly by 3
// steps per frame,
// and then ends in the same world-scroll routine the live ship uses.
//
// LIVE-OUT: DEMO_SCRIPT_DWELL (0xADF2), the script cursor DEMO_SCRIPT_POINTER_LO/HI (0xADF3/0xADF4),
// PLAYER_HEADING (0xA802) -- all [seen] -- and whatever scrollWorldAtTheEraPace writes.
