/** runSceneryForEra — run a frame of the scenery. The first slot is handed to the opening step as its
 * seed; from there each step advances both cursors and the next step inherits them, so nothing outside
 * chooses where the run starts. The era index then picks one of three fixed running orders: one for the
 * first era, one for the fifth, and one shared by everything between — including an index past the
 * fifth, which falls to that middle order rather than being refused. LIVE-OUT: memory, plus the two cursors.
 *
 * ROM 0x2CBC-0x2CDA plus 0x2CF5-0x2D14. Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x2cbc).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. The scenery (the clouds and other parallax objects) lives in eight sprite
 * slots, array slots 16-23, whose records start at SCENERY_RECORD_SLOT0 0xA900 [seen] and whose
 * sprite entries start at SCENERY_ENTRY_SLOT0 0xAA30 [seen]. This is their driver, separate from the
 * object handlers: the round engine and the pre-round lead-in arms call it each frame. Every step
 * in a running order drifts one object by a fraction of the frame's world scroll -- half, three
 * quarters or five quarters -- so nearer objects move faster than farther ones, and lays any extra
 * tiles the object is made of. Each order fills exactly eight slots (mechanisms.md).
 *
 * The era split here is {0}, {1,2,3}, {4}: different from the pace split and the turn split that
 * other routines apply to the same ERA_INDEX 0xAD04 [seen].
