/** dressSpriteForHeadingOrRetireAtEdge — dress one object's sprite entry so it shows the way it is heading, unless the object
 * has just reached the field edge, in which case it is retired instead.
 *
 * ROM 0x4447-0x44C8 (lift: translated/loc_4447.js). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x4447).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. This is the dressing step for a TWO-SPRITE object (mechanisms.md, sprite
 * dressing): it fills the pair of shape bytes at entry +1 / +3 and the pair of colour/flip bytes at
 * entry +0x30 / +0x32 -- the second sprite bank sits 0x30 above the first, which is why the
 * attribute bytes are 0x30 along (see PLAYER_SPRITE_ATTRIBUTE in names.js: "Slot 0's +0x30
 * descriptor byte"). Its caller is the Mother-Ship's step (loc_43f0), which moves the pair
 * by its own velocity plus the world scroll and then calls this to dress it (mechanisms.md: "0xFF
 * (live) moves the pair ... and dresses it").
 *
 * When the era cell holds one fixed value (ERA_INDEX 4, the last era) the object is given a plain
 * two-frame flutter and its wind-down counter is stepped, capped, or closed out once it overruns; on
 * any other era a heading-quadrant picks a shape pair and the era picks a colour, and one half of the
 * compass swaps the pair into the two entry slots in its own colour while the other half biases that
 * colour by half a page -- adding 0x80 flips bit 7, one of the two mirroring bits of the attribute
 * byte, which is how the pair is drawn mirrored (mechanisms.md).
 *
 * PARAMETERS: record = the object's record (the ROM's IX); entry = its sprite entry (IY). Both
 * arrive from the caller as it left them.
 * LIVE-OUT: the object's sprite entry and wind-down cell, plus whatever the retire or close-out
 * tail leaves in memory. */
