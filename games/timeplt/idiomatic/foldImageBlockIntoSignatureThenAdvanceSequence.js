 * foldImageBlockIntoSignatureThenAdvanceSequence — one step of the tamper-check sequence.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS: ROM 0x17E2-0x17FA, tag [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x17e2). It raises one flag cell to all
 * bits set, folds a fixed block of the program image into a running total seeded from an image byte,
 * banks the result, and steps the inner sequence index on.
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE: an anti-tamper check. The banked total, TAMPER_IMAGE_SIGNATURE (0xAA6F), is read
 * once, by the sequence arm at ROM 0x2730 as `cp 0x76`, which jumps off the genuine path (to 0x2530) on
 * a mismatch; 0x76 is what the thirty ROM bytes at 0x335E sum to on a genuine image (names.js, the cell
 * and foldBlockIntoTotal's "why", which puts that read three frames after this one). So a modified
 * image sends the game off its genuine path a few frames later.
 *
 * The flag cell, TAMPER_FOLD_FLAG (0xAA3F), is written here and no routine reads it back by address
 * (names.js). A second pointer is walked in step with the block and contributes nothing to the total.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory-only.
