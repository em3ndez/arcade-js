 * selectFoldBlock — hand back where a fixed block of the program image starts and how many bytes of it
 * to take; nothing is read and nothing is written.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS: ROM routine 0x08AE [seen]. Both values are constants chosen here, so the whole content of
 * this entry is WHICH block, and whatever a caller held in the two registers that carry them is
 * discarded. The block is thirty bytes starting at seatCaptionPenFromEraFoldingTamperIntoPhase's own
 * entry point -- that routine's CODE, read here as data.
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE: one step of the game's anti-tamper machinery. The only transfer into this
 * address is a tail jump from 0x4BD9, whose single caller loads a seed byte and then runs the summing
 * loop at 0x291E (`add a,(hl)` / `inc hl` / `djnz`) over exactly this pointer and count, banking the
 * total in a cell a later sequence arm reads. Patch those thirty bytes and the total moves; this entry
 * is where the block to be summed is chosen.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: the pair -- the block's start (the ROM leaves it in HL) and its byte count (in B).
