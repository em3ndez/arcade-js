/** isScoreBelow — answer whether one three-byte number is below another. Both are read most
 * significant byte first, from the two addresses given and DOWNWARD, and the first byte that
 * differs settles it; all three equal counts as not below. The answer is the whole product —
 * nothing is written, and it is mirrored into carry for a caller that reads it there.
 * LIVE-OUT: the boolean.
 *
 * ROM 0x4D2B-0x4D39 (frozen lift translated/loc_4d2b.js). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x4d2b).
 *
 * Role in the machine: the comparison step of the high-score insertion sort. Its only caller,
 * fileScoreIntoHighScoreTable, walks the five eight-byte records of the high-score table top-down,
 * asks this for each whether the finished player's score is below that record's, and inserts the new
 * score at the first record it is NOT below (mechanisms.md, "The high-score table and initials entry").
 * Under MAME it was dispatched five times in one frame at game over, the candidate pointer on the
 * active player's score and the standing pointer walking 0xAB0B at a stride of eight (names.js "why").
 *
 * Parameters: candidate — address of the HIGH byte of the score being filed (the ROM hands it in DE);
 * standing — address of the HIGH byte of a standing table score (in HL). Each score is three packed
 * bytes stored low-to-high in memory, so reading from the given address downward goes most
 * significant first.
