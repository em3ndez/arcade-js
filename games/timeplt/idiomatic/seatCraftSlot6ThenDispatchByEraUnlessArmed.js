/** seatCraftSlot6ThenDispatchByEraUnlessArmed — unless the Mother-Ship is up, hand slot 6's craft record + entry cursors to the era arm. LIVE-OUT: memory.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS: the last of the seven small per-slot entries of the enemy-craft band. Time Pilot keeps
 * its enemy craft in a band of seven object records at 0xA850 (stride 0x10), each paired in lockstep
 * with a sprite entry at 0xAA1A (stride 0x02); slot 5 is the Mother-Ship. This entry services slot 6:
 * record CRAFT_RECORD_SLOT6 (0xA8B0) with sprite entry CRAFT_ENTRY_SLOT6 (0xAA26).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE: stepSevenCraftSlots (0x28A1) runs slots 0-4, then the Mother-Ship slot, then
 * this one (mechanisms.md). Slot 6 has a second duty: once the Mother-Ship is armed it occupies TWO
 * consecutive records -- its own (MOTHER_SHIP_STATE, 0xA8A0) and slot 6's -- and from then on it is
 * driven by armMotherShipOrStep, not by the ordinary craft handler. So this entry stands down while
 * MOTHER_SHIP_ARMED is set, exactly like its twin seatMotherShipSlotThenDispatchByEraUnlessArmed.
 *
 * ROM: 0x28FE (0x28FE-0x290D), frozen lift translated/loc_28fe.js. Grounding tag: [seen] (names.js).
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory only -- whatever the selected era handler writes into slot 6's record and sprite
 * entry; nothing at all when the gate is closed.
