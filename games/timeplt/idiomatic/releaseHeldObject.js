/** releaseHeldObject — release a held object once its delay runs out. A countdown in the object
 * record's fifteenth byte ticks down by one per entry, and while it is still running that
 * tick is the whole effect; on the tick that lands it on zero the record's first byte —
 * the code a slot is held in — steps on by one, and the countdown cell reloads with 128.
 * LIVE-OUT: memory only — one cell every entry, two on the entry that releases.
 *
 * ROM: 0x2B52. Tag [seen] (names.js). Role in the machine: the waiting stage of an enemy-craft slot.
 * Its five callers, the per-era slot services serviceEra0EnemyCraftSlot through serviceEra4EnemyCraftSlot,
 * come here only when the slot's state byte holds exactly the held value, so the step on
 * the state byte always turns held into live, never an open-ended bump.
 *
 * Parameter: `slot` is the object record's address (the ROM's IX).
