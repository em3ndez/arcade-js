 * flyLiveSlotAndTickCountdown — service one live slot of the per-slot object sweep.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS: ROM 0x418B-0x4193, tag [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x418b). Three steps: fly the slot's
 * object a step along its stored velocity (retiring it if that step took it onto a retire line), tick
 * the slot's own countdown at record offset 0x0E down by one, then close this turn of the sweep.
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE: one arm of the object-bank sweep body (0x40EA). The body sends a slot here only
 * when its marker byte reads 0xFF (live), ERA_INDEX is not 4, and the record's countdown at +0x0E is
 * nonzero; with a zero countdown the slot gets a chaseOneAimPointAndRetireAtTheLine frame instead
 * (names.js, the sweep body's role). So this is the phase of a live object's life in which it simply
 * flies on while its countdown runs out.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory. Whatever the sweep's turn-closer hands back is returned.
