 * Role in the machine: a sound asked for only in the later eras. Both callers test ERA_INDEX
 * first: askForSoundWhileTheGroupIsClear (which also waits on the frame tick and on a group of
 * era-object slots being clear) and advancePlayerAnimationStrip (on the opening frame of the
 * strip). mechanisms.md records that which sound this is, heard at the latter site, is not yet
 * identified.
 *
 * The code is LATE_ERA_PROGRESS_SOUND (0x07FE), a byte of the program ROM read as data (the lift
 * notes it holds 0x86). It goes through enqueueSoundIfGameInProgress, so it is queued only while
 * PLAY_ACTIVE is set.
