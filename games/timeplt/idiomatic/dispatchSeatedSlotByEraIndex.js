/** dispatchSeatedSlotByEraIndex — run the per-slot handler the low three bits of the era index select out of a word
 * table laid down inline just behind this entry, on the object record the caller seated. Each case is
 * the slot's literal target, called directly with that record, and nothing here runs after it. Three
 * bits admit eight slots: the first five are the five eras' slot services; the sixth and seventh hold
 * words that address no program at all, so reaching one is a fault and it is raised, not assumed
 * away; the eighth holds the word of the intro-animation step, and that is what it runs. The record and
 * its sprite entry come in as arguments and each handler is entered directly, with no table word
 * carried in on a register pair. LIVE-OUT: memory, and the handler's. */

/*
 * ROM 0x290E-0x2913 (the dispatch) + 0x2914 (the inline 8-word table ERA_SLOT_DISPATCH_TABLE),
 * grounding [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x290e).
 *
 * ROLE. The common tail of every per-slot craft entry (seatCraftSlot0..4ThenDispatchByEra and the two
 * gated siblings): the entry seats a slot's record and sprite entry, and this picks HOW that slot
 * behaves this frame from the era the player is in. Time Pilot's five eras (A.D. 1910, 1940, 1970,
 * 1982/83 and 2001 in gameplay.md) each fly their enemy craft differently, and ERA_INDEX (0xAD04, [seen]) is the
 * number of the current one.
 *
 * MECHANISM IN THE ROM. `ld a,(0xad04) / and 0x07 / rst 0x30`: RST 0x30 is the game's computed-jump
 * helper; it treats the address after the RST (0x2914) as a table of two-byte targets, doubles A to
 * index it, and jumps to the word it finds. Because it JUMPS, the chosen handler returns directly to
 * whoever called this entry -- nothing runs after it here, which is why each case below simply
 * returns the handler's result.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory, plus whatever the chosen handler leaves.
