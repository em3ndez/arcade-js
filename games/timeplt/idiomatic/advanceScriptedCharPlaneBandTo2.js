/** advanceScriptedCharPlaneBandTo2 — advance one frame of the scripted character-plane animation, chosen by bit 0 of a
 * per-pass counter. Even passes blank two plane columns and six loose cells to the blank tile. Odd
 * passes read the byte under the script cursor: 0xff ends the script — the counter is zeroed, the
 * stage set to 2 and the cursor stepped back one, returning early with no decrement. Otherwise the
 * saved run is laid back down a column, two cursor bits each nudge a set of row counters up, the
 * column's shapes are stepped twice through the script, and the column is gathered back into its
 * run. Every non-early pass ends by decrementing the counter. LIVE-OUT: memory.
 *
 * ROM 0x142A-0x14C4 (frozen lift translated/loc_142a.js). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. When a round is won, the sequence machine plays a "band" animation on the
 * character plane before the next era starts (mechanisms.md, "Round won: the band animation").
 * armRoundWonBandAnimationThenStepSequence stocks the control block at 0xA9F0-0xA9F8 once --
 * BAND_TO2_PASS_COUNTDOWN (0xA9F2) to 0xFF, BAND_SCRIPT_CURSOR (0xA9F7) to BAND_SCRIPT_START
 * (0x56F1) -- and then stepRoundStartIntroAnimation (0x1323) calls this entry on each frame it runs
 * (those with FRAME_TICK bit 1 clear) while INTRO_ANIMATION_STEP (0xA9F0) is 1. This is the FIRST half of the band script; the second half is
 * advanceScriptedCharPlaneBandTo4, which this entry hands over to by writing step 2.
 *
 * THE GEOMETRY. The band is one video-RAM column (column 0x11 of the 32x32 character plane) split
 * into two thirteen-cell runs -- the upper run ending at CHAR_PLANE_UPPER_RUN_BOTTOM 0xA5D1, the
 * lower run from CHAR_PLANE_LOWER_RUN_TOP 0xA631 down to CHAR_PLANE_LOWER_RUN_BOTTOM 0xA7B1 -- with
 * two centre cells (0xA5F1 / 0xA611) between them and four "stub" corner cells in the neighbouring
 * columns (0xA5F0, 0xA5F2, 0xA610, 0xA612). Under the board's ROT90 a fixed native column is a
 * horizontal line on the glass, so the runs read as a full-width streak with flares at its centre.
 * A 32-byte copy of the column lives in the never-displayed first row of the plane (0xA400-0xA41F);
 * restoreColumnFromSavedRun lays it down and gatherCharColumnIntoBackingRun takes it back up, so the
 * edits made between them persist even though the blanking passes wipe the visible cells.
