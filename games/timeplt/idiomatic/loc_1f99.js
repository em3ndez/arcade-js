/** loc_1f99 — a stretch of table bytes decoded as instructions rather than a hand-written routine.
 * The ADDRESS is a live data table (velocity/direction rows) that real routines read as DATA; only
 * this ROUTINE, decoding those bytes as CODE, is a dead arm. It is reached as code only through a fold
 * arm that the whole live-in space proves is never taken (0 of 65536), itself downstream of a
 * copyright-glyph tamper divert that a genuine image never fires.
 * Decoded as code the bytes churn a long run of stack pops through the flag pair and finally transfer
 * to a computed / off-map address. Unreachable in real play, so it is modeled as a throw rather than
 * reproducing the churn. LIVE-OUT: none — control never returns; entry is the trap. */
