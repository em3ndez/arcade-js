/** postAttractInfoCaptions — one arm of the two-level sequence machine: stamps the copyright strip,
 * flashes the copyright line, then posts a fixed run of caption codes to the command ring as
 * (1, code) pairs, two of them chosen by two work cells, then bumps the sequence counter twice on the
 * high branch and once on the low.
 *
 * ROM 0x1830-0x1869 (lift: translated/loc_1830.js). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x1830).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. Step 2 of sequence phase 2, "a credit on the board, waiting for start"
 * (inner index 2 of dispatchSequencePhase2SubStepArm; mechanisms.md "Step 2"). It lays out the
 * information text of the screen in one burst -- the captions are only REQUESTS on the command ring; the ring's
 * drain draws them later. Which bonus-life pair appears follows the operator's bonus-life
 * setting, and which credit line appears decides where the sequence goes next:
 *   - two or more credits: caption 25 and two steps, straight to step 4;
 *   - otherwise: caption 23 and one step, to step 3, the one-credit wait
 *     (stepCopyrightScreenAwaitingStart).
 * LIVE-OUT: memory. */
