/** sweepObjectSlotBankServicingFirstSlot — sweep a fixed bank of object slots for one frame from the seated cursors. Each slot's
 * marker routes it: empty is skipped, the ballistic marker flies the object a step, any other marker
 * services its shape-cycle. Cursors stride one record and one sprite entry per slot; the seated count
 * bounds the pass, and the first slot is always serviced. LIVE-OUT: memory; returns where the cursors
 * stopped ({ record, sprite, count }, the count run out to zero).
 *
 * ROM 0x4008 (the loop body at 0x4008-0x4016 plus the loop head at 0x3FF9). Grounding: [seen]
 * (names.js ROUTINES 0x4008).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. Part of the era-0 three-slot object bank that the round engine runs once per
 * frame (mechanisms.md, "Era 0"). The bank's slots are ERA_OBJECT_RECORD_SLOT0..2 (0xA8C0, 0xA8D0,
 * 0xA8E0) with sprite entries ERA_OBJECT_ENTRY_SLOT0..2 (0xAA28, 0xAA2A, 0xAA2C). In the ROM this
 * address is not a separate routine but a mid-loop entry point of the sweep whose head is 0x3FF9
 * (sweepObjectSlotBankByHead): the point reached once a slot's marker has been found to be a
 * countdown; the ROM reaches it with `jr nz,0x4008` (from 0x3FEA's first-slot test, and from the
 * loop head at 0x3FF9). In this port its callers are:
 *   - serviceEra0BallisticObjectBank (0x3FEA), when the bank's first slot carries a countdown marker;
 *   - advanceSlotThenSweepObjectBankByHead, when it strides onto such a slot part-way through.
 * Because the marker was already tested by whoever arrives here, the slot the cursors point at on
 * entry is serviced unconditionally; every following slot is routed by its own marker.
 *
 * WHAT A SLOT IS. A 0x10-byte object record (cursor `record`, the ROM's IX) paired with a two-byte
 * sprite entry (cursor `sprite`, the ROM's IY). Record byte +0 is the marker: 0x00 empty, 0xFF a
 * ballistic object, anything else a countdown for the one-shot shape cycle.
 *
 * PARAMETERS. `record` / `sprite` / `count` default to the IX, IY and B registers the ROM caller
 * leaves seated; `count` is how many slots remain including the one at `record`.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory (slots and sprite entries serviced); returns { record, sprite, count } with the
 * cursors one stride past the last slot and count 0.
