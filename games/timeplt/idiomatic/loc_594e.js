/** loc_594e — hand back the perpendicular component pair an object's heading calls for, at the pace one fixed table
 * of velocity samples sets. Choosing it is all this entry does; an incoming pointer is discarded. LIVE-OUT: the pair.
 *
 * ROM 0x594E-0x5953 (frozen lift translated/loc_594e.js): `ld hl,0x5e00 / jp 0x596e`. Grounding: [seen]
 * (names.js ROUTINES 0x594E).
 *
 * What it is: a two-instruction shim in front of velocityForHeading (ROM 0x596E). velocityForHeading
 * reads an object's heading (record byte +2, a point on a 256-step circle) and returns two samples a
 * quarter turn apart from whatever 256-word velocity table it is handed; the two samples are the
 * object's perpendicular velocity components, and the table's peak value is the speed. This entry
 * exists only to hand it ONE particular table.
 *
 * Role in the machine: the table here is OPENING_ERA_VELOCITY_TABLE 0x5E00, the velocity ladder rung
 * that peaks at 256 (1.0 pixel per step in 8.8 fixed point) — the pace of the opening era (1910)
 * according to mechanisms.md's velocity ladder. Its siblings loc_5965 (0x2E3E, peak 306) and loc_596b
 * (0x08FA, peak 331) are the same shim with the other two rungs the ship uses.
 *
 * Whatever pointer the caller had in HL is overwritten by the table base before the jump, which is
 * why no incoming pointer survives.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: the component pair velocityForHeading leaves (DE, BC); no memory is written.
