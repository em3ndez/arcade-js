/** fireAndSweepPlayerShots — on a fire-button rising edge arm and seed one shot into a free slot of the
 * six-slot player-shot bank, aimed along the ship heading; then move every live shot by the world scroll,
 * dropping any that leaves the field or whose head byte is stale.
 *
 * ROM 0x23E3-0x2508 (lift: translated/loc_23e3.js). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x23E3).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. The whole of the player's gun. The round engine calls it right after the
 * player's own frame (serviceRoundThenResolvePlayerState; flyEnemyFreeLeadInThenStepSequence
 * also calls it), so a shot always moves by the scroll the ship
 * has just set. The player's shots are NOT sprites: each lives in a 16-byte record of
 * PLAYER_SHOT_ARRAY 0xAA80 [seen] holding its whole 8.8 position, and is drawn as a two-by-two
 * block of character cells by queueTileStampForObject (mechanisms.md, "The player's shots").
 *
 * Shot record layout used here: +0 head byte (0 free, 0xFF live, anything else marked -- e.g. the
 * 0xF0 destroyTargetsHitByShots writes on a hit); +3/+4 the first coordinate as an 8.8 word
 * (fraction, whole); +5/+6 the second; +10/+11 and +12/+13 the two per-frame seeds.
 * LIVE-OUT: memory. */
