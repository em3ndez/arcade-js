/** flyAlongStoredVelocity — fly one object a single step along the velocity it CARRIES, and in the same add
 * carry it with the world.
 *
 * Each of the object's two coordinates is sixteen bits stored split: the whole part in the
 * sprite entry, the fraction in the record, so a step smaller than a pixel banks instead of
 * vanishing. Each coordinate gains its own velocity word — read out of the object's own record
 * rather than looked up from a heading — PLUS a per-frame displacement held in a fixed pair of
 * cells that every object shares. The two are folded into one add, which is why nothing else may
 * drift this object: a separate drift beside this would apply that shared displacement twice.
 * LIVE-OUT: memory only — the four coordinate bytes; nothing is clamped and nothing returned.
 *
 * ROM 0x3E05-0x3E35 (lift: translated/loc_3e05.js). Grounding: [seen].
 *
 * Role in the machine: the player's plane stays centred and the world scrolls past it, so every
 * object must move by the world scroll as well as by its own motion. The shared displacement is
 * WORLD_SCROLL_Y (0xA808) and WORLD_SCROLL_X (0xA80A) — named for the NATIVE sprite axes; under the
 * board's ROT90 native Y is the display's horizontal. The velocity words at +0x0A..+0x0D are
 * banked by other routines (e.g. spawnAimedEnemyIntoEraBankWhenInWindow and
 * launchBankEnemyWhenAimedNearPlayer), never by this one; its sibling flyAlongHeading looks the
 * velocity up from a heading instead. Callers include serviceSlotByHeadByte, runParachutistSlot,
 * flyAndRetireSlotCyclingShapeInEra4 and advanceTwoTileObjectThenTryAimedSpawn.
 *
 * `object` is the object's record (the ROM's IX); `sprite` is its sprite entry (the ROM's IY).
