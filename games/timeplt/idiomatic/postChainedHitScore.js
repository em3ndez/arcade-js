/** postChainedHitScore — post the next entry of an eight-long climbing chain, one entry per call, and
 * re-arm the window that keeps the chain alive. A call arriving while the window cell still
 * holds a count advances the step cell and posts a value that climbs with it, wrapping back to
 * the first entry after the eighth; a call arriving once the window has run down to zero posts
 * the first entry and leaves the step cell alone. Both paths re-arm the window, so closely
 * spaced calls climb and an isolated call starts over. LIVE-OUT: memory-only.
 *
 * ROM 0x51DE-0x5204 (frozen lift translated/loc_51de.js). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES
 * 0x51de). Role in the machine: this is how a shot-down enemy craft or a ramming contact is paid
 * for (mechanisms.md, scoring). It does not add to the score itself; it posts a scoring command
 * to the command ring, and the ring's command-4 handler does the award. Hits in quick succession
 * therefore pay 100, 200 … 800 and then wrap to 100 (mechanisms.md).
 *
 * The other half of the chain lives elsewhere: expireHitChain, in the round engine's service
 * block, counts CHAIN_WINDOW [seen] down once per pass and clears CHAIN_STEP [seen] once the
 * window is empty. Without that outside reset the climb would never restart.
