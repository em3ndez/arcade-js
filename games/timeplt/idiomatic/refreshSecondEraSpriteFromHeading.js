/** refreshSecondEraSpriteFromHeading — show an object pointing the way it is heading, in this family's own shape bank and
 * tint. The heading lookup supplies a shape and the byte that goes beside it; each is then shifted
 * by a fixed bias before it is stored, so the pair on the screen is a fixed distance from the pair
 * the lookup chose and the shift is the whole of what this entry adds. LIVE-OUT: the two cells
 * written.
 *
 * ROM 0x2A47-0x2A56 (frozen lift translated/loc_2a47.js). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES
 * 0x2a47). Role in the machine: the heading-dressing step for the enemy craft of the SECOND era
 * (era index 1). The era dispatcher picks its arm by era index alone, and under MAME this entry
 * ran only at era 1, while a game held in the first era used refreshSpriteFromHeading (0x2A3C)
 * instead. It dresses the seven ordinary craft records 0xA850-0xA8B0 into sprite entries
 * 0xAA1A-0xAA26 (names.js).
 *
 * `object` is the craft's record (IX), whose heading the lookup reads; `sprite` is its sprite
 * entry (IY).
