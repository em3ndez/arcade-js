/** velocityForHeading — turn an object's heading into the pair of numbers that will move it. The heading
 * counts a whole turn in 256 steps and the caller's table is read as that many signed 16-bit
 * samples, so the sample a quarter turn back is the perpendicular partner of the one at the
 * heading; their shared length is the speed, chosen by choosing the table. Which of the pair is
 * the screen's across and which its down is not settled here.
 *
 * ROM 0x596E-0x598D (frozen lift translated/loc_596e.js). Grounding: [seen].
 *
 * Role in the machine: turns a heading into a velocity for the movers. Its callers include
 * flyAlongHeading, flyAlongHeadingAtDoubleVelocity and doubledVelocityForHeading, each passing the
 * table that sets its speed; scrollWorldAtTheEraPace passes an era-chosen table, and
 * negateVelocityIntoWorldScrollThenDressSprite negates the pair this returns into the scroll cells
 * that driftWithWorldScroll adds to every world-static object — negated player velocity applied to
 * everything else is the camera. The selectable tables hold a near-constant magnitude around the
 * heading circle, not an exact one.
 *
 * `table` is the base of the caller's 256-word table (HL on the Z80); `heading` defaults to byte +2
 * of the object record in IX, as the ROM reads it (`ld a,(ix+0x02)`).
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: the pair (DE, BC). */
