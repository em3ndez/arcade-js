/**
 * loc_12e2 — run the sequence delay down by one and, on the frame it reaches zero and only then, let the
 * sequence take its next decision.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS: ROM 0x12E2-0x12FA, tag [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x12e2). It is arm 11 of the phase-3
 * sub-step jump table at 0x0F29: the sequence machine dispatches it each time it services that
 * sub-step.
 *
 * WHY IT KEEPS A HEX NAME: the prologue `ld hl,0xA9EB / dec (hl)` is an idiom the image reuses at seven
 * places (0x12E2, 0x16D6, 0x174E, 0x1792, 0x196A, 0x330B, 0x56B8), two of them arms of this same table, so
 * a delay name would not tell them apart. What is particular to this entry is only the tail it chooses,
 * and passTurnToOtherPlayerIfLivesElseStepSequence already carries that decision (names.js "why").
 *
 * The countdown wraps rather than sticking, so a delay that starts at zero buys a full 256 frames before
 * the decision comes round again. On every other frame the one decremented cell is the whole effect.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory-only.
