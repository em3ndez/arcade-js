/** driftNearestSceneryTriTile — drift one scenery object with the world scroll, over-travelling it a quarter, then
 * place the tile abutting it and the one cornering it, and step both cursors past.
 *
 * ROM 0x2D21-0x2D2C: three calls and a tail jump into advanceToNextSlot (0x309B).
 * Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x2D21).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. One member of the scenery parallax family that runSceneryForEra dispatches
 * over the eight scenery slots (SCENERY_RECORD_SLOT0 0xA900 / SCENERY_ENTRY_SLOT0 0xAA30). It is
 * the NEAR object of the 1940-1982 eras (eras 1-3): at five-quarter pace it moves faster than the
 * world and so reads as in front of the playfield, and its three tiles sit on three corners of a
 * square -- one abutting straight on, one cornering diagonally; the fourth corner is never written
 * (mechanisms.md, scenery; names.js placeDiagonallyAbuttingTile). Only the first tile drifts; the
 * others are rebuilt from it every frame, so the object never comes apart. It uses three slots.
 *
 * PARAMETERS: record = the object's 16-byte record (the ROM's IX), entry = its two-byte sprite
 * entry (IY) -- the paired cursors every slot sweep carries.
 * LIVE-OUT: memory, cursors (left on the slot after the object's last tile). */
