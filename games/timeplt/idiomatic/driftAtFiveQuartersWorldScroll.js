/** driftAtFiveQuartersWorldScroll — carry one object along with the scrolling world, over-travelling it by a quarter.
 * Each of the object's two coordinates is 16 bits stored split: the whole part off one base, the
 * fraction off the other. Both gain a displacement read from a fixed pair of cells rather than
 * from the object — so every object running this drifts alike — lengthened by a quarter of
 * itself before it lands, which carries the object further than those cells hold.
 * LIVE-OUT: memory only — four bytes; nothing is clamped and nothing is returned.
 *
 * ROM 0x2D6E-0x2D92 (frozen lift loc_2d6e). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x2D6E).
 *
 * Role in the machine: Time Pilot's ship never moves on the glass. Each frame its velocity is
 * turned into a displacement, negated, and stored in WORLD_SCROLL_Y (0xA808) [seen] and
 * WORLD_SCROLL_X (0xA80A) [seen]; everything else on screen is moved by that displacement so the
 * world appears to fly past. Scenery gets parallax from three sibling routines, each moving an
 * object by a different fraction of the displacement — driftAtHalfWorldScroll (half),
 * driftAtThreeQuartersWorldScroll (three quarters) and this one (five quarters). An object moved by
 * more than the whole displacement LEADS the world rather than lagging it. Its callers are the
 * scenery wrappers dispatched by the era-keyed scenery dispatcher, every dispatch seated inside the
 * scenery slots (names.js; mechanisms.md, the scroll and scenery section).
 *
 * Parameters: `object` is the object record (IX in the ROM), holding the fractional byte of each
 * coordinate; `sprite` is its sprite entry (IY in the ROM), holding the whole byte of each
 * coordinate — the bytes the video hardware reads as the sprite's position.
