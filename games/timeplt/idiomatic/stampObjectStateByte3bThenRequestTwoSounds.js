/** stampObjectStateByte3bThenRequestTwoSounds — force the head byte of the record the index register points at to one fixed value,

 * and the value is the only thing this entry contributes. LIVE-OUT: that byte, and the handover.
 *
 * ROM 0x3ECB-0x3ED1. names.js tag: [seen] -- "force the head byte of the record the caller points at
 * to 0x3B, then request two sounds (requestTwoSounds); what the byte held is discarded unread, so this
 * is a clamp and not a step".
 *
 * Role in the machine: the two-sound twin of stampObjectStateByte3bThenRequestSound. Its caller is
 * runSlotCountdownDriftAndAnimateElseRetire, which first decrements a slot's countdown byte and then,
 * when the value read before that decrement was 0x3C or more, calls this to overwrite it with 0x3B. The handover is
 * requestTwoSounds (0x5683), which queues two sound codes read from program bytes
 * (TWO_SOUND_REQUEST_FIRST_CODE 0x07A6 and TWO_SOUND_REQUEST_SECOND_CODE 0x4CDA), admitted while
 * PLAY_ACTIVE or DEMO_SOUNDS_ENABLE is set (enqueueSoundIfGameOrAttract, 0x5617).
 *
 * `object` is the record base -- the index register the caller has seated on the current slot. */
