 * countTheKillAndGrantTheSharedToken — the tick a hit object's death begins: ask for the death sounds,
 * take one off the round's kill quota, and, past three guards, grant this object the single-holder
 * "last of the wave" token.
 *
 * ROM 0x2BBA-0x2BDD. Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x2BBA).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. Called from stepDyingObjectState, the per-object state step, on the paths where a
 * death begins (names.js notes a third static call site at 0x2A38 that is dead code). `object` is the base of
 * the dying object's sixteen-byte record (the ROM's IX).
 *
 * UNCONDITIONAL PART. The two death sounds are requested (requestTwoSounds, ROM 0x5683) and KILLS_REMAINING
 * (0xAD02) [seen] — the quota whose reaching zero brings on the Mother-Ship — is decremented, but floored at
 * zero rather than wrapped.
 *
 * THE TOKEN. A wave of craft carries a shared claim: when the wave spawns, WAVE_KILL_COUNTDOWN (0xA811) [seen]
 * is set to how many qualifying kills it takes and WAVE_CLAIM_TIMER (0xA812) [seen] opens a time window. Each
 * qualifying kill ticks the countdown; the kill that zeroes it writes its record's slot ordinal, with the top
 * bit set, into CLAIM_TOKEN (0xA821) [seen]. driveObjectAppearanceByPhaseBand later honours and consumes the
 * token (names.js CLAIM_TOKEN). The guards: the record's cooldown byte has its top bit set, and the window is
 * still open. The countdown is spent whenever those two pass, so every qualifying kill ticks it, not only the
 * winner.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory.
