/** paintQuadTile — lay down one four-tile block and colour the whole of it in one go. The four cells
 * are the one the cursor names, its neighbour one address back, and the two a line-stride on from
 * those; they take four consecutive tile codes counting up from a base the caller fixes -- the
 * cursor's cell base+1, its neighbour the base, and the lower pair base+2 then base+3 -- so the
 * block is one picture cut into quarters and not four independent tiles. Each of
 * the four then gets the caller's single colour, written a fixed distance lower in the address
 * space — a subtraction, so a cursor already on the colour side is carried a further block down
 * rather than left where it is. The cursor comes out two line strides on, clear of the block just
 * written, so a caller can chain the next against it.
 * LIVE-OUT: the eight cells, the cursor, and the colour pointer.
 *
 * ROM: 0x0E70. Tag [seen] (names.js). Role in the machine: one of a family of block painters named by
 * block SIZE — drawSlotWithOneGlyph (one glyph beside a blank), paintDoubleTile (two cells) and this one
 * (four) — each leaving the cursor clear of what it drew: the two narrow ones one line stride on, this
 * one two. The routine that splits a value into counts of thirties, tens, fives
 * and ones calls a different painter per denomination and chains the cursor between them; this one
 * draws both the tens and the thirties, with only the base code and the colour differing.
 *
 * Parameters: `cell` is the drawing cursor in the character plane (the ROM's DE), `firstTile` the
 * block's base tile code (B), `colour` the one colour for all four cells (C). */
