/** scrollWorldAtTheEraPace — move the world past the ship at the pace the era sets. It READS the heading rather than
 * deciding it: some paths in write it first and others arrive with whatever is already there. One of
 * three fixed velocity tables is picked from ERA_INDEX alone — the opening era its own, the next two sharing a second,
 * everything from the third era up sharing a third — and the pair that table gives for the ship's heading is handed on to
 * be negated into the world scroll. The three tables are one curve at three sizes: peaks of 256, 306 and 331, within 0.75%
 * of pure scaling of one another, rungs on a ladder of six that climbs in steps of 25. What the era picks is a rung.
 * LIVE-OUT: memory.
 *
 * ROM 0x1F42-0x1F54 (with the three table-loading stubs at 0x594E / 0x5965 / 0x596B).
 * Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x1f42).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. The player's ship never moves on screen -- its sprite stays pinned while
 * the world scrolls past it. So "flying" is this routine: every frame the live ship runs, the
 * ship's velocity is looked up and applied, reversed, to the world. It is reached from
 * dispatchPlayerFrameByState (stick centred), turnShipTowardTargetHeading, snapHeadingOntoTheTurnTarget
 * and the demo autopilot flyDemoShipByScript. There is no throttle: pace changes only with the era.
