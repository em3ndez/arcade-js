/** enqueueSoundIfGameOrAttract — request a sound while a game is in progress, OR while the cabinet is set to make
 * sound during its attract loop. Two permission cells, tested in that order, and either one on
 * its own is enough; only with both clear is the request dropped. LIVE-OUT: memory.
 *
 * ROM 0x5617-0x5627 (frozen lift loc_5617). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x5617).
 *
 * Role in the machine: one of three gates in front of the pending-sound queue
 * (appendSoundCommandToQueue, the enqueue body at 0x562A); the frame service later sends one
 * queued code per frame to the audio board. Its siblings are enqueueSoundUnconditional (always)
 * and enqueueSoundIfGameInProgress (in play only). This one adds the attract case, so sounds
 * requested through it are heard in the attract demo too when the operator has enabled that.
 *
 * The two cells:
 *   - PLAY_ACTIVE (0xAD30) [seen] — set for the whole of a credit's play, clear in attract;
 *   - DEMO_SOUNDS_ENABLE (0xA9C6) [code] — the attract-sound gate, one of the gameplay DIP-switch
 *     settings unpacked at boot.
 *
 * Parameter: `command` — the sound code to queue (A in the ROM).
