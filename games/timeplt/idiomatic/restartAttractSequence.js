/** restartAttractSequence — restart the outer sequence from a standing start.
 * The in-play flag, the inner step index and the active-player index are cleared, then the outer
 * phase is set from a byte of the program image rather than an immediate. A fold over three more
 * program bytes then writes the inner index a SECOND time: an address is stepped by one byte, its
 * low half combined with its high half and a constant taken off. On an unaltered image that fold
 * comes back to zero and the second write agrees with the first; on a moved image it does not, and
 * the sequence restarts at some other step. LIVE-OUT: memory only.
 *
 * ROM 0x12FB-0x1318 (frozen lift translated/loc_12fb.js). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES
 * 0x12fb). Role in the machine: the way out of the round engine (outer phase 3) back to the top
 * of the attract sequence (phase 1). It is the shared teardown reached both when the attract
 * demo ends and when a real game ends; only the game-over path arrives with PLAY_ACTIVE still
 * set (names.js). Under MAME every firing wrote the same five stores, the last one zero.
 *
 * Anti-tamper: the folded bytes 0x4901-0x4903 sit inside the copyright caption's record, so an
 * image with an altered credit line restarts attract at a wrong step instead of failing cleanly.
