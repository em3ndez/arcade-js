/** armWholePlaneWipeThenDerailOnATamperedImage — seat the whole-plane wipe's cursor and line count,
 * then fold a fixed run of the program image into one eight-bit total and hold it against a genuine
 * image's value. A mismatch hands control to a tail that unwinds the interrupt frame one word out of
 * step, returning to a non-address; the wipe is armed either way. LIVE-OUT: memory only.
 *
 * ROM 0x019A-0x01B4 (frozen lift translated/loc_019a.js). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. Phase 0 of the sequence machine is the power-on wipe (mechanisms.md, "Phase 0:
 * the power-on wipe"). Its first arm, startTheWholePlaneWipeAndFoldAnImageBlockIntoThePhase (0x15E2),
 * calls this entry once; afterwards blankNextLine (0x01C2) erases one line of the character plane
 * per frame, reading the two cells seated here, until the count reaches zero.
 *
 * WHY "WHOLE PLANE". blankNextLine walks a line in steps of 32 cells and then moves the cursor on by
 * ONE cell, so a cursor at the plane's first cell (CHAR_PLANE_BASE 0xA400) and a count of 32 lines
 * covers the whole 32 x 32 plane, 0xA400-0xA7FF, exactly.
 *
 * WHY A CHECKSUM HERE. Most arms of sequence phases 0-2 carry an image fold like this one
 * (mechanisms.md, "Tamper checks"); this one is unrelated to the wipe and gates nothing above
 * it -- the wipe is armed first, whatever the fold says. The folded run, 0x4BA5-0x4C94, starts at the code of loadDefaultHighScores (0x4BA5), read
 * here as data.
