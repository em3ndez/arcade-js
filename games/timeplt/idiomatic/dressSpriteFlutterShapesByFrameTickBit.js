/** dressSpriteFlutterShapesByFrameTickBit — give an object the two shapes of a two-frame flutter, picked by one bit of a counter
 * cell rather than by anything the object holds: one bit set selects one pair of shape codes,
 * clear selects the pair two higher. The two codes go into two slots of the same sprite entry, so a
 * single object is drawn from two shapes at once. Which pair is live changes only as fast as that
 * bit does; nothing here advances it.
 *
 * ROM 0x44DC-0x44F0 (frozen lift translated/loc_44dc.js). Grounding: [seen].
 *
 * Role in the machine: the last step of dressing a two-sprite object in the final era. Its callers
 * are dressSpriteForHeadingOrRetireAtEdge (which, in ERA_INDEX 4, writes the attribute bytes and
 * then hands the shapes to this -- mechanisms.md) and restartAnimationCounterThenDressFlutterSprite.
 * The counter cell is FRAME_TICK (0xA980), advanced once per vertical blank, so bit 2 flips every
 * four frames and the flutter holds each pose for four frames.
 *
 * Parameter: `sprite` is the object's sprite entry (ROM IY).
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory, two bytes. */
