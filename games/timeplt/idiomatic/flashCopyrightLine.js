 * flashCopyrightLine — make the copyright line change colour every frame.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS: ROM 0x0B39-0x0B45, tag [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x0b39). It queues one fixed command on
 * the command ring whose ARGUMENT alternates: the lowest bit of the frame counter chooses between two
 * arguments, and nothing else about the pair varies. The counter is only read.
 *
 * WHY IT IS A COLOUR FLASH: command 1 draws a caption record from the caption table at 0x0C50 using that
 * record's own colour byte. The two arguments, 0x00 and 0x1F, pick two records with the same destination
 * (0xA6BC) and the same thirteen glyphs (a copyright mark, KONAMI, 1982), differing only in colour, 0x10
 * against 0x05 -- so only the colour can alternate (names.js "why" for 0x0b39, confirmed by a MAME write
 * tap on the line's first colour cell).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE: called by the sequence arms that keep the copyright screen up -- among them
 * postAttractInfoCaptions, stepCopyrightScreenAwaitingStart and stepTwoCreditCopyrightScreenAwaitingStart
 * (steps 2-4 of phase 2, mechanisms.md) -- which restamp the copyright strip and then flash its line.
 * The frame counter advances once per vblank, so the colour flips on every frame.
 *
 * Queueing is not a guarantee -- the ring append drops the pair when the ring cell the write cursor names
 * has not yet been consumed, and this entry never learns that, so a frame can silently miss its turn.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory (the command ring), plus, on the odd-frame path, the pair left in the registers.
