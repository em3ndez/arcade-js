 * destroyFixedTargetReachedByPlayer — ROM 0x507E [seen]
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. The collision test between the player's own ship and the one fixed target held in
 * era-object slot 0 (record ERA_OBJECT_RECORD_SLOT0 0xA8C0, sprite entry ERA_OBJECT_ENTRY_SLOT0
 * 0xAA28): flying into it destroys both.
 *
 * ROLE. Both must still be live, and both coordinates must fall inside a wrapped window around the
 * meeting point, the window along one axis being wider than the other. When all four tests pass,
 * both are marked destroyed, the target's HITS_REMAINING is zeroed so the contact kills it outright
 * rather than costing it a hit, and the score is posted. Any test failing leaves everything
 * untouched, so this is a whole-or-nothing check. Undriven play never meets the four tests; under
 * MAME a poked run that brings the ship onto a fixed target does, and all three stores fire.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory only.
