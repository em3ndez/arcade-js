/** requestInterRoundSoundPair — request two particular sounds in turn, and only while the cabinet may make them.
 * Neither code is an immediate: each is fetched from a byte of the program image, and choosing
 * that pair is the whole of this entry — whatever a caller held is discarded. Both go through the
 * same permission test, so both can be refused together. LIVE-OUT: memory.
 *
 * ROM 0x56E4-0x56EF (frozen lift loc_56e4). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x56E4).
 *
 * Role in the machine: the sound pair between rounds. It is reached as a call from
 * advanceScriptedCharPlaneBandTo4 (when band-to-4 reaches its lower sentinel and sets step 4) and
 * by falling out of the bottom of requestRoundIntroSoundBurst. It has the same shape as
 * requestTwoSounds (0x5683), with a different pair of program bytes.
 *
 * The codes are INTER_ROUND_SOUND_1 (0x27CB) and INTER_ROUND_SOUND_2 (0x33A0). Both go through
 * enqueueSoundIfGameOrAttract, which admits them while PLAY_ACTIVE is set or while
 * DEMO_SOUNDS_ENABLE (the attract-sound setting) is set — so, unlike the in-play-only requests,
 * this pair can be heard in the attract demo.
