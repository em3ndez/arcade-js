/** presentChecksumForTamperTest — walk an address forward twice, by a wide step and then a narrow one, and hand back a
 * byte unrelated to either: the count the caller was already carrying, moved into the place a
 * result is read from. No memory is read or written, so the walked address is only an address.
 * LIVE-OUT: the walked address, and the byte handed back.
 *
 * ROM 0x200C-0x200F (frozen lift translated/loc_200c.js: `add hl,de / rst 0x18 / ld a,b / ret`).
 * Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x200c).
 *
 * Role in the machine: the last link of the image tamper check reached from showCreditLine.
 * sumImageBlockForTheTamperCheck folds a run of program bytes into one total,
 * parkTheImageTotalForTheTamperVerdict moves that total into B, and
 * advanceSequenceUnlessImageTampered (0x5303) calls here and then compares the returned byte with
 * 0x67 — stepping the sequence on a match, taking the tamper arm loc_0f8d on a mismatch. Under
 * MAME every dispatch arrived with the total already correct (A = B = 0x67) and the tamper arm
 * was never taken, so on a genuine image the check always passes (names.js).
 *
 * Why the address walk exists at all is not visible from here: nothing downstream reads the
 * address it lands on (names.js: "never dereferenced by anything downstream"), so it reads as a
 * decoy that makes the routine look like a table-index helper.
 *
 * PARAMETERS: hl, de, a = the address, the wide step and the narrow step of the walk (HL, DE, A);
 * b = the carried count handed back (B).
