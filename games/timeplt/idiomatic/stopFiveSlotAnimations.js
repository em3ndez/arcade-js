/** stopFiveSlotAnimations — while the byte a caller points at still reads zero, stop five consecutive records
 * at a fixed base: each is given the same shape byte and has its step timer cleared. A non-zero
 * byte means nothing at all is touched, so this is a guarded reset and not a step, and the guard
 * byte is the caller's while the five records are this routine's own. The Z80 left the guard byte
 * and its test flags, or the reset loop's spent counter, stride and record cursor, standing in
 * registers; nothing after the call reads any of them, so they are not handed back.
 *
 * ROM 0x3855-0x386D (frozen lift translated/loc_3855.js). Grounding: [seen].
 *
 * Role in the machine: the enemy-wave substep driveEnemyWaveForLifePhase dispatches here at life
 * phase 7. It leaves the first five enemy-craft records, from CRAFT_RECORD_SLOT0 0xA850 at a
 * sixteen-byte stride, standing on the shape a finished animation ends on. Why this is a STOP:
 * the animation machine counts a record's step byte down once per dispatch and returns without
 * writing when it reads zero, so a zero step is never raised again; and 0x11 is the first byte of
 * every one of the eighteen animation runs in the table at 0x3438 — the resting shape. The sites
 * that START an animation store 0x20 into the same step byte.
 *
 * `guardAddr` is the address of the caller's guard byte (HL on the Z80).
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: the ten bytes. */
