/**
 * buildCopyrightScreenThenVerifyImage — the sequence arm that lays out the title/attract copyright
 * screen, then checks a block of program bytes before letting the sequence move on.
 *
 * ROM 0x083E-0x086A. Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x083E).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. Table-dispatched (no static call site) by dispatchSequencePhase1SubStepArm, the
 * inner arm table of one outer sequence mode. It runs once: it paints the screen, and on a genuine image
 * steps SEQUENCE_SUBSTEP [seen] so the next frame runs the following arm.
 *
 * THE LAYOUT. Three pieces, all queued or stamped rather than drawn directly:
 *   - flashCopyrightLine (ROM 0x0B39) asks for the copyright line in one of two colours, picked by the frame
 *     counter's low bit, so it changes colour every frame it is requested;
 *   - stampCopyrightStrip (ROM 0x0B06) stamps the four fixed pieces of the copyright caption;
 *   - nine caption requests go onto the command ring as command 1 with arguments 0, 1, 3-7, 20 and 21
 *     (names.js: "post caption commands"); the foreground's command-ring drain runs them later.
 *
 * THE CHECK. XOR of the 24 program bytes at 0x176A (COPYRIGHT_IMAGE_CHECKSUM_BASE, the start of the routine
 * paintReadoutsThenSampleWitnessOrDerail) must be 0xC9 — it is on the genuine image (checked against the ROM
 * image). A mismatch jumps to loc_08fa, a checksum-failure landing whose bytes are really data; run as code it
 * always faults (names.js ROUTINES 0x08FA).
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory.
