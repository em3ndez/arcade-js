 * ROM 0x57F1-0x57F6 (frozen lift loc_57f1). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x57F1).
 *
 * Role in the machine: the coin/credit chime. Its callers are the coin and service-credit paths
 * (tallyCoinSlot1AndAwardCredit, meterCoinageTowardCreditOnEdge, awardOneCreditOnDebouncedInputEdge),
 * which run in attract as much as in play — a coin is normally inserted while no game runs, so a
 * gate on PLAY_ACTIVE would silence it. That is why this request goes through
 * enqueueSoundUnconditional rather than one of the two gated entries (mechanisms.md, "The sound
 * queue").
 *
 * The code is COIN_SOUND (0x322E), a byte of the program ROM read as data (the lift notes it holds
 * 0x01). The frame service later sends it to the audio board, one queued code per frame.
