/** holdCopyrightThenVerifyGlyphAndSeatWitnessOrDerail — a phase-1 attract sub-step arm. Hold one
 * sequence step for as long as its delay cell counts, restamping the copyright caption and flashing
 * its line on every frame of the wait. On the frame the delay expires, verify the copyright line's
 * colours (deferring to that guard, which derails on its own if they are wrong) and then verify the
 * "(c) KONAMI 1982" caption glyph: a pointer is built from a program byte — the first opcode of the
 * parachutist routine, read as data — which lands on the caption's N cell only on an untouched image,
 * and the glyph there must read 0x3B. If it does not, the sequence DERAILS into the anti-tamper trap
 * -- a caption record run as code that stores through whatever pointer it arrives with and
 * calls into unmapped space, so control is destroyed rather than reported; that landing has no
 * faithful transcription, so this raises where the transfer would land, as the colour walk's own
 * derail does. Otherwise one caption cell's glyph and colour are seated into the tamper-witness
 * pair and the sequence steps on. LIVE-OUT: memory only.
 *
 * The derived pointer is the tamper mechanism itself: add 2 to the program byte for the low pointer
 * byte, then add 0x6A for the high byte, so a modified opcode moves the read off the caption cell and
 * the glyph test fails. On the genuine image the byte is 0x3A, the pointer lands on the copyright
 * caption's N cell and the glyph is that N, so the derail is unreachable in normal play. */
