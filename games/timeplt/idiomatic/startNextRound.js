/** startNextRound — step the round counter, roll the era forward (wrapping after the fifth), and reload
 * the starting rung from one of three cells bracketed by how far into the run the round counter has got.
 * The kill quota is refilled from a non-era-keyed cell, so it is the same every round. Two flags are
 * cleared and a third set to all-ones, which leaves the round armed rather than merely counted.
 *
 * ROM 0x2DB8-0x2DF3 (frozen lift translated/loc_2db8.js). Grounding: [seen].
 *
 * Role in the machine: Time Pilot's five eras (the manual's rounds) are played in a loop. When a
 * round is over — its callers both gate on that — this moves the active player's context block
 * (0xAD00 on) on to the next one. Two counters are kept because they mean different things:
 * ROUND_NUMBER counts on without wrapping, which is what lets the game get harder on the second
 * lap, while ERA_INDEX wraps to pick which of the five eras is drawn. The escalation comes from
 * START_RUNG, which the playfield reset later copies into ERA_RUNG.
 *
 * Not reached by the MAME sweeps (none completed a round); every write seen to these cells in
 * those runs came from the per-player context copy instead. The claims below are checked against
 * the lift and against the cells' own entries in names.js.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory only. */
