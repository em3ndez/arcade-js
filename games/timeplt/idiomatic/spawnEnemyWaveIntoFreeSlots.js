/** spawnEnemyWaveIntoFreeSlots — spawn a wave across a fixed bank of object slots. A count is read (the configured
 * wave size, or five while MOTHER_SHIP_ARMED is set, i.e. a large boss craft is present); the bank is then walked that many times and every
 * free slot is filled from a randomly-picked spawn record of ENEMY_SPAWN_RECORD_TABLE — its first two
 * bytes seat the sprite entry's two coordinates (a starting position) and its third both heading
 * bytes of the record — while an ordinal within the pass picks a per-slot byte, the step
 * counter is primed, the shape animation is stepped once, and the slot head is marked live. A fixed
 * status byte is stored when the pass ends. LIVE-OUT: memory.
 *
 * ROM 0x386E-0x38D1. Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x386e).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. This is the final era's (2001) wave spawner: driveEnemyWaveForLifePhase
 * sends era 4 here instead of to the free-slot search the other eras use. It fills the seven-slot
 * enemy-craft band -- records from CRAFT_RECORD_SLOT0 0xA850 [seen] at a sixteen-byte stride,
 * sprite entries from CRAFT_ENTRY_SLOT0 0xAA1A [seen] at a two-byte stride. While the Mother-Ship
 * is armed (MOTHER_SHIP_ARMED 0xAD0D [seen]) the walk is shortened to five slots, since the two
 * slots at MOTHER_SHIP_STATE are taken.
 *
 * Unlike the other wave fill, every craft here goes live at once with its personal timer (+0x0E)
 * at zero and no hold, and its coordinate fractions (+3/+5) are left as they were. mechanisms.md
 * draws the consequence: none of these craft carries the top bit that the kill-counting guard
 * needs, so as far as the code shows, era 4 has no formation bonus.
