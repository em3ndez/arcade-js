/** dressSpriteForCoarseHeading — show an object pointing the way it is heading: its heading byte is rounded to one of
 * sixteen sectors, and that sector picks a shape and the byte beside it out of two parallel tables
 * in the program image, sixteen entries apart. The pair goes into the object's sprite entry, the
 * shape in one slot and the other byte in a slot further on. Rounding adds half a sector before
 * taking the top nibble, so a heading is snapped to the NEAREST sector rather than truncated, and
 * that addition wraps, which is what closes the circle of sectors. LIVE-OUT: memory, two bytes.
 *
 * ROM 0x2AFC-0x2B17 (frozen lift translated/loc_2afc.js). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. Each enemy object has a record (heading at +2) and a sprite entry whose
 * shape byte is at +1 and whose attribute byte (colour and flip) is 0x30 further on, in the
 * second of the two parallel sprite runs (mechanisms.md). serviceEra3EnemyCraftSlot calls this for
 * its craft; dressSpriteForFineHeading is the thirty-two-sector sibling another era's craft use.
 *
 * Parameters: `object` is the object's record (the ROM's IX) and `sprite` its sprite entry (IY).
