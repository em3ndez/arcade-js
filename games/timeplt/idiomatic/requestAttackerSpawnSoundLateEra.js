/** requestAttackerSpawnSoundLateEra — request one particular sound, and only while a game is in progress. Its code is
 * fetched from a byte of the program image. LIVE-OUT: memory.
 *
 * ROM 0x5674-0x5678 (frozen lift translated/loc_5674.js: `ld a,(0x276b) / jr 0x560c`).
 * Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x5674).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. The main CPU asks for sounds by appending a sound code to a queue in work
 * RAM, which the frame service feeds to the audio board. enqueueSoundIfGameInProgress (0x560C) is
 * the gate that lets a code into that queue only while PLAY_ACTIVE is set, dropping it otherwise.
 * Two routines lead here: commissionStagedAttackerByEra tail-exits into it when it commissions a
 * late-era attacker, and requestTwoSoundsWhilePlaying calls it as the second of its pair of
 * requests (names.js notes that only era 4 reaches the code directly, era 3 folding into the
 * mid-era path).
 *
 * The code is not an immediate: the ROM reads it from ATTACKER_SPAWN_SOUND_LATE_ERA (0x276B), a
 * byte of the program image that names.js records as this routine's sound-command code.
