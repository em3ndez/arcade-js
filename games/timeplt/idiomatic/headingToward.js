/** headingToward — the heading that points from one object at a point, as one byte of a
 * 256-step
 * circle. Each of the two axes gives a distance and a sense; the senses, plus which of the two
 * distances is the shorter, name one of eight sectors, and the shorter distance over the longer
 * places the answer within that sector at one of thirty-two rungs. A sector whose byte carries the
 * marker bit counts its rungs backwards, which is what makes the answer sweep the same way all the
 * way round. Two equal distances skip all of that and read a fixed heading straight out of a
 * second, shorter table. Nothing is written.
 *
 * ROM 0x33B8-0x3414 (frozen lift translated/loc_33b8.js). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x33b8).
 *
 * Role in the machine: the aiming primitive. Its answer is used as an angle by its readers —
 * names.js records launchBankEnemyWhenAimedNearPlayer testing it against the object's own heading
 * in a wrapped window, and reaimAndAnimateEnemyCraftOnPhaseTick adding half a turn before storing
 * it for steerTowardAimHeading to turn toward. The octant table (OCTANT_BASE_HEADING_TABLE, ROM
 * 0x3415) holds the eight multiples of 32, so the eight sectors tile the circle exactly.
 *
 * `point` addresses the target's pair of coordinate bytes (HL on the Z80): the byte at `point`
 * pairs with the object's +0x00 coordinate, the byte just below it with the object's +0x31.
 * `object` is the object's sprite entry (IY).
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: the heading, returned and in the accumulator. */
