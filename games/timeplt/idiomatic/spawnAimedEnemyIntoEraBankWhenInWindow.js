/** spawnAimedEnemyIntoEraBankWhenInWindow — spawn one aimed enemy, but only when the spawn slot is free, the cooldown at
 * ATTACKER_SPAWN_COOLDOWN is clear, the era count is live, and some object in the caller's two-slot bank passes
 * the doubled-window test (step 2 below). Draws a heading toward the player at ENEMY_STANDOFF_AIM_MAIN, alternates the aim's
 * side each spawn via ATTACKER_SPAWN_AIM_SIDE_TOGGLE, then seats coords, the doubled velocity pair, a script and a
 * shape into the era's fixed record+sprite bank and reloads the cooldown. LIVE-OUT: memory. The routine is a
 * pure writer — its sole caller (advanceTwoTileObjectThenTryAimedSpawn) tail-returns and reads no register it
 * leaves, and that whole dispatch chain up to serviceEra1BomberObject is memory-only — so the search pointers,
 * the window bound and the loop count all live here as JS locals. The aimed heading passes into the velocity
 * shim as an argument, and the shim hands the doubled pair back, which this routine reads straight into the record.
 *
 * ROM 0x3D25-0x3DD9. Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x3d25).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. An era object (reached from serviceEra1BomberObject's chain) uses this to
 * launch an attacker: a new object placed where one of the caller's two objects sits and sent off
 * on a heading aimed near the player. How often this can happen is governed by the era's
 * difficulty settings: ATTACKER_SPAWN_SLOT_COUNT 0xA8C6 [seen] (how many attacker slots the era
 * fields; zero disables the arm), ATTACKER_SPAWN_WINDOW_HALF 0xA8D6 [seen] (the half-width of the
 * window test), and the shared cooldown ATTACKER_SPAWN_COOLDOWN 0xA8F4 [seen], which is reloaded
 * from ATTACKER_SPAWN_COOLDOWN_PERIOD 0xA8F6 [seen] after every spawn.
 *
 * TWO DESTINATION BANKS. The new attacker goes into one of two fixed record + sprite-entry seats:
 * "bank A" = ACTOR_RECORD_SLOT3 0xA840 / ACTOR_ENTRY_SLOT3 0xAA18 [seen], or "bank B" =
 * ERA_OBJECT_RECORD_SLOT2 0xA8E0 / ERA_OBJECT_ENTRY_SLOT2 0xAA2C [seen]. Bank B is used when the
 * era's slot count is not 1 and bank B's head byte is 0 (free); otherwise bank A, which must itself
 * be free (head 0) or nothing spawns.
