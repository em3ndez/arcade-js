 * finishBootSelfTestAndColdStart — the tail of the power-on switch decode and self-test: store the
 * last two gameplay settings, set the screen-flip line, paint the power-on lattice, check a block of
 * the program image, and go on to the startup delay.
 *
 * ROM 0x49A8-0x49D5 (ends `jp 0x32EB`). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x49A8).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. One link of the power-on chain (each routine jumps into the next; none
 * returns). unpackTheFirstThreeSwitchSettings [seen] jumps here with the complemented gameplay
 * switch byte (DSW1) rotated so that its original bit 3 sits lowest; this routine takes the remaining
 * bits:
 *   bits 4-6 -> DIFFICULTY_SETTING (0xA9C4) [seen]   0..7, 0 the easiest
 *   bit 7    -> DEMO_SOUNDS_ENABLE (0xA9C6) [code]   whether the attract mode may queue sounds
 * It then hands on to petWatchdogThroughStartupDelayThenStartMachine [seen], which holds the lattice
 * on screen for the startup delay and starts the machine.
 *
 * THE SELF-TEST. Time Pilot scatters program-image checks through the whole game. This one sums
 * the 256 bytes at BOOT_SELFTEST_CHECKSUM_BASE (ROM 0x27DE); a genuine image totals 0xC5. It does not
 * refuse to boot: a mismatch runs one frame service out of band and then the machine cold-starts
 * anyway. On a genuine image that arm is never taken.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: the two settings cells, the watchdog write, FLIPSCREEN_LATCH, the painted character
 * plane, and everything the chain after it does — control never comes back.
