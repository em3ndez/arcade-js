/** dispatchSequenceSubStepArm — inner level of the two-level sequence machine for the round-engine
 * mode: the low nibble of the sub-step picks one of sixteen arms out of a fixed inline word table,
 * that arm runs, then the fixed continuation every arm returns into. Each case is the slot's literal
 * target, called directly; the nibble mask means every one of the sixteen slots is reachable and
 * every one names a transcribed arm, so no index can fall off the table. No arm reads a register the
 * dispatch would have left standing — each opens on a cell read or a fixed-argument call — so the arm
 * is entered directly, with no return slot parked for it and no table word carried in on a register
 * pair. LIVE-OUT: memory, and the continuation's.
 *
 * ROM 0x0F1F-0x0F28; the sixteen-word arm table sits inline at 0x0F29
 * (PHASE3_SUBSTEP_DISPATCH_TABLE). [seen]
 *
 * Role in the machine: Time Pilot's frame-by-frame behaviour is a two-level state machine. The outer
 * level, SEQUENCE_PHASE (0xA9AB), is the machine's mode -- 0 boot wipe, 1 attract, 2 credit / push
 * start, 3 round engine -- and the frame service picks one handler per mode. This file is the handler
 * for phase 3. The inner level, SEQUENCE_SUBSTEP (0xA9AC), says where in the round's life the machine
 * is: each arm does its step for this frame and, when its step is finished, advances the sub-step so
 * the next frame runs the next arm. Phase 3 is used by both real play and the attract demo.
 *
 * In the ROM: `ld hl,0x0f54 / push hl` parks advanceAttractTowardGameStart as the address every arm
 * returns to, then `rst 0x30` indexes the inline table with the sub-step's low nibble.
