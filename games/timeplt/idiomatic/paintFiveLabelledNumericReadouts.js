/** paintFiveLabelledNumericReadouts — paint five labelled numeric readouts up the tile plane, handing each one's source

//
// ROM 0x4BDC-0x4C13 (five `ld hl / ld de / ld c / call 0x4c1f` groups); lift: translated/loc_4bdc.js.
// Grounding tag in names.js ROUTINES: [seen].
//
// ROLE IN THE MACHINE. The five sources are the five eight-byte records of the high-score table at
// HIGH_SCORE_TABLE_BASE (0xAB08..0xAB2F; per record +0 rank, +1..+3 score, +4..+7 name glyphs, per
// names.js), so the five readouts are the high-score table rows as they appear on screen. Two
// callers draw them: erasePenRouteThenOpenInitialsEntry, as it lays out the initials-entry screen,
// and paintReadoutsThenSampleWitnessOrDerail. Each row is painted by paintLabelledNumericReadoutColumn
// (0x4C1F) [seen] as one upward column of the tile plane: a three-tile pictogram picked by the
// record's lead byte, a six-digit field, then a three-tile suffix, every cell given the row's pen.
// (The monitor is mounted ROT90 -- manifest.js -- so a column of the tile plane is a line of text on screen.)
//
// LIVE-OUT: the tile and colour cells of the five rows (0xA0F1-0xA719 per names.js); no register
// result -- the pen is dead after return.
