/** stampTwoByTwoTileBlock — stamp one two-cell-square emblem at the cursor, colour all four cells
 * walking back across the square, and leave the cursor past it.
 *
 * ROLE. Ring command 5's handler (names.js, word-table slot 5 at 0x0BBC) calls this to draw its row
 * of 2x2 award emblems. The character plane (from 0xA400) holds one shape code per cell; the colour
 * plane sits a fixed 0x400 bytes below it (from 0xA000) with one colour byte per cell. The monitor
 * is rotated, so a line of text on the glass runs through the plane in steps of -0x20 (one native
 * row), and +/-1 is the same place on the neighbouring line (see advanceCharCursor).
 *
 * With the cursor at P, the four shape codes counted up from the caller's base B land as:
 *
 *     P     = B+3      P-0x20 = B+1        (the cursor's own line)
 *     P-1   = B+2      P-0x21 = B          (the neighbouring line)
 *
 * All four cells then take the same colour C in the colour plane, written in the reverse of the
 * order the shapes were (P-0x20, P-0x21, P-1, P). The cursor is stepped once after each pair of
 * shapes, so it comes out at P-0x40: two cells along, the width of the emblem, ready for the next.
 *
 * ROM 0x4DAF-0x4DCE (frozen lift translated/loc_4daf.js). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES
 * 0x4daf). LIVE-OUT: memory, eight cells, and the stepped cursor, which is both kept in de and
 * returned.
