// ROLE IN THE MACHINE. The sequence machine's phase 2 is "a credit on the board, waiting for start"
// (mechanisms.md). This is its step 3, the ONE-credit wait: this arm runs every frame, with the
// copyright line on screen, until a start is pressed or a second credit arrives. Step 2
// (postAttractInfoCaptions) sends the machine here with exactly one credit; with two or more it goes
// straight to step 4, the two-credit wait, which is where this arm also sends it when a second credit
// arrives. A two-player game can only be started from step 4.
//
// LIVE-OUT: memory only -- the display list and caption requests, the sampled witness pair at
// TAMPER_GLYPH_STRIP, and on a start whatever startOnePlayerGame sets up.
