/** advanceHitSoakingObjectThenAnimateDeath — advance one object that is still soaking up hits. While HITS_REMAINING is left, spend
 * one, keep the record live and re-request the pair of sounds, then hand off to the ordinary move.
 * Once no hits remain, run the record head down toward retirement, and at the values it crosses
 * reseat the sprite entry from the shape table. LIVE-OUT: memory.
 *
 * ROM 0x3B94-0x3C08 (frozen lift translated/loc_3b94.js). Grounding: [seen] in names.js.
 *
 * Role in the machine: this handles the big two-tile object that takes several hits to kill.
 * HITS_REMAINING (0xA8DC) counts the hits it can still ABSORB; a hit arriving while that count is
 * non-zero only spends one and the object keeps flying. When the count is already zero the hit is
 * fatal, and this routine then plays the object's death: the record head (0xFF while live) becomes
 * a countdown, the two tiles change colour, then shape, the kill is scored, and the slot retires.
 *
 * Parameters: `ix` is the object's record, `iy` its sprite entry (the two tiles are adjacent
 * entries: +0x00 X, +0x01 tile, +0x30 attribute, +0x31 Y for the first; +0x02/+0x03/+0x32/+0x33
 * the same for the second). `a` is the record head plus one as the caller hands it over — the ROM
 * opens with `dec a` to recover the raw head. */
