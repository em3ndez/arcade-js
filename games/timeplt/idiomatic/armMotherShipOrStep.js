 * armMotherShipOrStep — the once-in-eight-frames gate for the Mother-Ship.
 *
 * ROM 0x43B7-0x43E7. Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x43b7).
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. Every era of Time Pilot ends with a Mother-Ship: once the player has destroyed the
 * era's kill quota (KILLS_REMAINING 0xAD02, the manual's 56), the big ship appears and must be shot
 * seven times. This routine decides, frame by frame, whether the Mother-Ship is already on the field
 * (in which case its own state machine runs) or whether it is time to bring it on.
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. Called once per dispatch of the round engine's service list
 * (serviceRoundThenResolvePlayerState, phase-3 sub-step 7). While the Mother-Ship is
 * live it simply hands the frame to loc_43f0 (ROM 0x43F0). Otherwise it arms the Mother-Ship
 * at most once every eight frames, and only when the quota is spent and its two-slot record bank
 * (MOTHER_SHIP_STATE 0xA8A0 and the record one stride on, 0xA8B0) is empty. Arming raises
 * MOTHER_SHIP_ARMED (0xAD0D), seeds the lead record's hit counter with seven, and retires the record
 * and its sprite-entry pair (MOTHER_SHIP_ENTRY 0xAA24) into a cooldown, from which the Mother-Ship's
 * stepper launches it.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory.
