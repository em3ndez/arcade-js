/** serviceSlotByMarkerThenCloseSweepTurn — one turn of the per-slot sweep over an object bank: pick the slot's handler from its
 * marker byte and let that handler close the turn. A free slot (marker zero) is passed over; any
 * marker other than full is a drifting countdown object, stepped and then passed; a full marker is
 * a chased object whose handler turns on the era and on the record's countdown — the final era runs
 * the approach-then-breakaway handler, a live countdown flies the slot and ticks it, and a spent one
 * chases its aim point for the frame. Every path ends in closing the turn, which goes round again
 * while turns remain. The record cursor, the sprite-entry cursor and the turns left are this turn's
 * arguments and are handed on as arguments. LIVE-OUT: memory. */

//
// ROLE IN THE MACHINE. Each object bank is an array of sixteen-byte records (the object's state) with a
// parallel array of two-byte sprite entries (where and how it is drawn). sweepEra2PlusObjectBank
// (0x40D6) seats the record cursor (ix), the sprite-entry cursor (iy) and the turn count (b), then
// enters here; closeOneTurnOfTheSlotSweep (0x410B) steps both cursors one slot on, counts b down and
// re-enters this body while turns remain. So a call here services this slot AND every slot after it --
// the whole remaining bank -- and every arm below ends by closing the turn.
//
// The record's first byte, the marker, says what kind of occupant the slot has:
//   0x00        free -- nothing to do this frame;
//   0x01..0xFE  a counting object whose marker is its own countdown (see stepCountdownSlotThenCloseTurn);
//   0xFF        a full, live object whose handler depends on the era and on the countdown at +0x0E.
//
// LIVE-OUT: memory -- the records and sprite entries of this slot and the ones after it, as the
// handlers and the turn-closer leave them.
