/** fillCellRun — lay one byte across a fixed run of thirteen cells of a character line.
 * The cursor starts where the caller left it and steps back thirty-two addresses per cell, one
 * cell further along the line, so all thirteen come out uniform — a blanking character in the
 * character plane, a colour in the colour plane. LIVE-OUT: those thirteen cells, plus the
 * cell-step register left holding minus thirty-two, which callers walk on from without reloading
 * it. The run length is fixed here; the caller chooses only where it starts and what fills it.
 *
 * ROM 0x1319-0x1322 (lift: translated/loc_1319.js — `ld de,0xffe0 / ld b,0x0d /
 * loop: ld (hl),a / add hl,de / djnz loop / ret`). Grounding: [seen].
 *
 * Why minus thirty-two is "one cell along the line": the tilemap is 32 cells to a row in video
 * RAM, so -0x20 is one row back. The board is rotated a quarter turn (ROT90), so a fixed
 * video-RAM column shows on the glass as a horizontal line, and stepping a row in memory steps
 * one cell along that line. Callers (the scripted band animations advanceScriptedCharPlaneBandTo2
 * and ...To4, armRoundWonBandAnimationThenStepSequence, paintCaptionColourBandAndStepSequence)
 * start it at a run's bottom cell — e.g. CHAR_PLANE_LOWER_RUN_BOTTOM (0xA7B1) or its colour-plane
 * twin — and it walks up thirteen rows.
 *
 * `fill` is the byte to lay (the ROM's A) and `start` the first cell (the ROM's HL).
