 * driveObjectAppearanceByPhaseBand — drive one object's appearance from a phase byte in its own record, in three bands.
 *
 * At 42+ only the tint moves: the sprite's top two attribute bits are kept and a free-running
 * counter's low nibble dropped beneath them, cycling sixteen tints while the shape holds.
 * Between 10 and 41 the phase is halved into a step that picks a shape from a sixteen-entry table
 * (one fixed tint), so shapes advance at half the phase's speed.
 * Below 10 the object lives only while CLAIM_TOKEN names it — top bit set and low seven bits
 * matching this record's number, else it is retired; while named the phase advances seven frames in
 * eight, a fixed shape and tint hold, and only its first phase posts a command and clears the token,
 * consuming it once. LIVE-OUT: memory-only.
 *
 * ROM 0x2C31-0x2C93 (frozen lift loc_2c31). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x2C31).
 *
 * Role in the machine: the "phase" is the object's state byte, the first byte of its object
 * record. names.js places this routine on the path a slot takes once that byte is neither free,
 * live nor held — in practice a craft that has been shot down, whose state byte is a death
 * countdown that stepDyingObjectState steps down each frame (mechanisms.md). So this is the wreck's
 * animation: high counts flicker through tints, mid counts step through a sixteen-entry
 * explosion shape table, and below ten the wreck is removed at once — except for the one wreck
 * that holds the wave's claim token.
 *
 * The claim token: the kill that empties the wave's kill countdown writes its own slot ordinal,
 * top bit set, into CLAIM_TOKEN (0xA821) [seen]. The record numbered to match is the formation
 * bonus wreck: it holds a fixed shape and tint, and because this routine bumps its count back up
 * seven frames in eight while stepDyingObjectState steps it down every frame, it lingers on
 * screen. On the frame its count reads 1 it posts command 4 with argument 12 — score award
 * index 12, 2,000 points (mechanisms.md, scoring) — and clears the token so the award is paid once.
 *
 * Parameters: `object` is the object record (IX in the ROM); `sprite` is its sprite entry (IY in
 * the ROM), whose +1 is the shape code and +0x30 the attribute (tint) byte.
