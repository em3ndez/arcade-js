 * setMotherShipVelocityFromHeading — ROM 0x46BA [seen]
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. Gives the Mother-Ship the velocity its current heading calls for, at the speed the
 * current era sets. stepMotherShip calls it with the Mother-Ship's record (under MAME every
 * dispatch had IX = 0xA8A0, MOTHER_SHIP_STATE; names.js).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. Speed is chosen by era and nothing else. The ROM pushes the address of the
 * block at 0x46CE as a return slot, masks ERA_INDEX (0xAD04) to three bits and dispatches through
 * the arm table right after `rst 0x30` at 0x46C4. Each of the five defined arms is a bare
 * `ld hl,<table>` into the shared sampler at 0x596E (velocityForHeading [seen]), so each arm here
 * is simply the table it names: 0x59D7, 0x5E00, 0x5E00, 0x2E3E, 0x08FA for eras 0-4 -- rungs of a
 * ladder of scaled copies of one waveform, i.e. speeds. The sampler reads the record's heading
 * (+0x02) and returns two perpendicular components: the word at the heading and the word a quarter
 * turn (0x40) behind it. The arm's `ret` then lands on 0x46CE (fileTwoPairsIntoObjectRecordHighByteFirst
 * [seen]), which files them into the record at +0x0C/+0x0D and +0x1C/+0x1D, high byte first, where
 * the Mother-Ship's motion reads them.
 *
 * The mask admits eight indices where the table defines five, so an index past the end reads the
 * first bytes of that block as though they were an entry: two of those words name no routine and
 * fault, and the last names the six-digit painter, which is run as the machine would run it.
 * These arms are unreachable on a genuine image, where ERA_INDEX stays 0-4. The object's record is
 * an argument (the ROM's IX). LIVE-OUT: memory.
