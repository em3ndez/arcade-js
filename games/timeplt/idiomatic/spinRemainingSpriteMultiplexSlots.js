/** spinRemainingSpriteMultiplexSlots — a caller's tail into the five-slot display pass, entered
 * inside the first slot.
 *
 * ROLE. Time Pilot shows some hardware sprites twice per frame (the sprite multiplex): a request
 * bit (bit 7) in a sprite's bank-1 Y byte asks for it, and once the raster (SCANLINE_COUNTER,
 * 0xC000) has passed that sprite's line the pair "trades" -- the request is cleared from the Y byte
 * and 128, half the coordinate range, is added to the partner bank-0 X byte, so the same sprite is
 * drawn again half the range away further down the frame. The waiting pass for hardware sprites
 * 19-23 is one 32-byte block per sprite (ROM 0x10F8 onward, loc_10f8). This routine is the ROM
 * entry at 0x10FD, five bytes into sprite 19's block, just past the block's own `ld a,(Y) / bit 7,a`:
 * the caller arrives with a byte already held (A) and already tested (the Z flag), and both are
 * used as if that block had loaded and tested sprite 19's Y byte itself.
 *
 *  - A clear test means no request: sprite 19 is stepped over.
 *  - Otherwise the held byte is the request; if the raster has come (held + raster carries past
 *    255) sprite 19 trades from the held byte. If it has not, the ROM jumps back to the head of the
 *    block (0x10F8) -- here, the whole five-slot pass restarts via loc_10f8 and re-reads every slot.
 *  - Sprites 20-23 then trade wherever their own top bit is set.
 *
 * The ROM spins on the raster before each trade (and pads with a net-zero `inc hl/inc hl/dec hl/
 * dec hl` delay); that hold is not reproduced here -- the same bytes land either way.
 * mechanisms.md records the only caller in the image as a CALL NZ at 0x15D9 on a path through
 * undefined opcodes from 0x15CA; whether any real execution reaches this entry is open (§9).
 *
 * ROM 0x10FD-0x1198 (frozen lift translated/loc_10fd.js). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES
 * 0x10fd). LIVE-OUT: memory only.
