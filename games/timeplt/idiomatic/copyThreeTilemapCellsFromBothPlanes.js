/** copyThreeTilemapCellsFromBothPlanes — take a copy of three tilemap cells, each into its own two-byte keep.
 * A table in the program image supplies three records of two addresses: where to read, and where
 * to put what was read. Each cell is read TWICE, a fixed distance apart, because the two planes of
 * the tilemap sit that far from one another — so what a keep holds is the pair of bytes belonging
 * to ONE cell, not two cells. The pair is stored the second read first. Both of the arithmetic
 * steps are deliberately narrow: the distance is added to the high half of the source alone and
 * the keep is stepped in its low half alone, so either would wrap inside its own page rather than
 * carry out of it.
 *
 * ROM 0x4B30-0x4B4A (frozen lift translated/loc_4b30.js). Grounding: [seen].
 *
 * Role in the machine: its one caller is startOnePlayerGame, which runs it after painting the
 * credit-count panel and before seating sequence phase 3. The ROM parks the first byte in the
 * alternate accumulator (`ex af,af'`) while it reads the second; here it is simply held in a local.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory, six bytes. */
