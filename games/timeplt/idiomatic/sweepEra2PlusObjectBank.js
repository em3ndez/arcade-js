 * ROM 0x40D6-0x40E9, grounding [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x40d6).
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. Time Pilot keeps a small "era-object bank" of special objects beside the enemy craft:
 * three 16-byte records starting at ERA_OBJECT_RECORD_SLOT0 (0xA8C0), each paired with a two-byte
 * sprite entry starting at ERA_OBJECT_ENTRY_SLOT0 (0xAA28). Which routine drives that bank depends on
 * the era (ERA_INDEX, 0xAD04): era 0 has its own entry (serviceEra0BallisticObjectBank), era 1 its own
 * (serviceEra1BomberObject), and from era 2 upward the bank is run by THIS entry, which only gates and
 * seats the sweep; the per-slot work is the sweep body serviceSlotByMarkerThenCloseSweepTurn (0x40EA).
 *
 * ROLE. One of the round engine's object services: each call either returns at once or services
 * the bank's slots once each, as many as the slot count below says.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory only -- the sweep body writes the slots' records and sprite entries.
