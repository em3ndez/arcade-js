/** dispatchEra4CollisionByFrameParity — the era-4 per-frame collision dispatch, split by frame parity. On even frames run the
 * whole player-versus-object collision-and-destruction pass. On odd frames stage one shot-versus-
 * target sweep over a run of object slots and hand it the shared destruction body: while the mother
 * ship is armed the run is nine long and a following mother-ship mutual-kill pass runs after it;
 * while it is clear the run is eleven long and no mother-ship pass follows. The two cursor cells the
 * shared body reloads between passes are staged in memory first so every pass restarts on this run.
 * LIVE-OUT: memory.
 *
 * ROM 0x4F2A-0x4F34 plus its interior arm 0x5032-0x507D (frozen lift translated/loc_4f2a.js).
 * Grounding: [seen] in names.js.
 *
 * Role in the machine: reached only as the era-4 tail of dispatchCollisionPassByEra — in the last
 * era (ERA_INDEX 4) collision work is split across two frames instead of being done all at once.
 * FRAME_TICK (0xA980) advances once per frame, so its bit 0 alternates: even frames run the full
 * pass, odd frames run the shot-versus-target sweep below. */
