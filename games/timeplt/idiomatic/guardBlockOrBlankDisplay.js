/** guardBlockOrBlankDisplay — let the sequence move on only if a block of the program image still adds up.
 * A running eight-bit total is seeded from one program byte and fifty-one more added. When it is
 * the one expected, the inner sequence index is stepped. Otherwise the display is switched off
 * through the output latch — the written value taken from a program byte too — and one character
 * cell is copied into a pair of work cells (glyph then the colour beside it); that arm leaves the
 * sequence index put, so nothing after it runs. The Z80 also left the total, its spent counter,
 * two cursors and the compare's flags standing in registers; nothing that runs after either arm
 * reads any of them, so they are not handed back.
 *
 * ROM 0x17B9-0x17E1 (frozen lift translated/loc_17b9.js). Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x17b9).
 *
 * Role in the machine: an anti-tamper step of the sequence machine. It is the eighth entry of the
 * word table at 0x1659 that dispatchSequencePhase1SubStepArm dispatches, so a patched image stalls
 * the sequence here with a dark screen. The 51 bytes it adds are the start of stampCopyrightStrip's
 * own code (0x0B06), so the guard covers that routine; names.js records that the total over the
 * real image is exactly the value compared. The witness pair it writes on failure (TAMPER_WITNESS)
 * is the one seedSceneryEntriesThenRunScenery later checks.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory. */
