/** seatTheStackAndSettleTheControlLatch — power-on, the first code that decides anything. It probes the
 * expansion socket: an empty socket floats the bus high, never a fitted board's answer, so the question
 * always returns "no" and the rest runs; a "yes" would hand control to the expansion. Then it quiets the
 * watchdog, drives the control lines low, and enables the picture. The original also seats the stack just
 * under sprite memory here; this layer lays no return words (every routine is a direct call and the frame
 * interrupt fires as one), so nothing reads the stack pointer and the seat is not carried. The latch takes data from the low bit and its line from the address,
 * TWO ADDRESSES TO A LINE, so the eight-address walk settles FOUR lines (each written twice) and the ninth
 * address is a fifth line, not a ninth; that last setting is read from the program image, not a literal, so
 * patching it can leave the machine dark. No work memory is touched. LIVE-OUT: latched lines.
 *
 * ROM 0x07B1-0x07D1, reached from the reset jump at 0x0000. [seen]
 *
 * Role in the machine: the first stage of the cold start. It leaves the board in a known state -- the
 * frame interrupt shut (latch line 0 low), the picture on -- before 0x0069 clears memory. Latch lines
 * 5, 6 and 7 are never written here (names.js), so "settle the latch" means five of its eight lines.
