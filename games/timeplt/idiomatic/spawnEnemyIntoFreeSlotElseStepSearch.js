/** spawnEnemyIntoFreeSlotElseStepSearch — work one object slot in a downward search for a free one. A slot whose head byte is
 * already taken is left untouched and the turn is handed to the tail that steps to the next slot;
 * a free slot is claimed and stocked. Stocking draws a heading from the scroll angle jittered by a
 * random amount, reads a starting position (the sprite entry's two coordinate bytes) from two chained
 * tables through it, and seeds the record and
 * its paired entry with facing, script and a fresh animation. LIVE-OUT: memory. Every register the
 * body touches is dead-after-return scratch — the table walk holds its cursor and index in JS
 * locals, every arm hands on to a callee that reseats what it needs, and the four callers each
 * tail-return this result and read no register back, so nothing survives. The two cursors and the
 * count of turns still owed ride in as arguments and are handed on to the tail with the slot taken.
 * At most one slot is filled per turn.
 *
 * ROM 0x37D6-0x382C. Grounding: [seen] (names.js ROUTINES 0x37d6).
 *
 * ROLE IN THE MACHINE. This is how ordinary enemy craft enter play one by one: under MAME it
 * fills the enemy-craft band (records from 0xA850) one slot at a time. The search is a loop made
 * of two routines -- this one and closeOneTurnOfTheFreeSlotSearch, which steps both cursors back
 * one slot, counts a turn off and comes back here -- entered from spawnEnemyCraftWhenBandUnderTwo,
 * gateTheFreeSlotSearchAndPickItsRun and loc_3793. Once a slot is filled the search ends, since
 * this arm returns instead of handing on to the tail.
 *
 * The record layout used here (mechanisms.md, "The record, byte by byte"): +0 head/life state,
 * +1 aim heading, +2 current heading, +3/+5 coordinate fractions, +9 animation step timer,
 * +0x0A animation run selector, +0x0E the slot's personal timer. The sprite entry holds the two
 * native-axis coordinate bytes at +0x00 and +0x31.
