// ROLE IN THE MACHINE. Once the round's kill quota (KILLS_REMAINING) is spent, armMotherShipOrStep
// arms the Mother-Ship: it takes the last two records of the craft band, MOTHER_SHIP_STATE (0xA8A0)
// [seen] and the one after it (0xA8B0), with its sprite entry at MOTHER_SHIP_ENTRY (0xAA24) [seen],
// and seeds the record's +0x04 byte (MOTHER_SHIP_HITS_TO_ABSORB, which counts the hits it can absorb)
// with 7 and the idle delay at +0x0E. From then on this routine is its whole life, and the record's
// head byte (+0x00) is its phase:
//
//   0x00         IDLE      count the delay at +0x0E down; when spent, launch (launchMotherShipFromPlayerHeading).
//   0xFF         LIVE      move with its velocity and the world, dress the sprite, and fire at the
//                          player when it may (flyMotherShipOneFrame -> tryToFireFromMotherShip -> fireMotherShipShotIntoFreeSlot ->
//                          launchAimedMotherShipShot).
//   0xF0         HIT       written by a collision sweep. While hits remain one is absorbed and the ship
//                          goes back to LIVE (absorbMotherShipHitElseStepItsDeath); so it takes eight hits to kill.
//   0xEF..0x01   DYING     with no hits left the head counts down one per step (stepMotherShipWreckCountdown): at 0xEF
//                          it sweeps the whole field (sweepFieldOnMotherShipDeathElseStepWreck), from 0xE4 down it plays its warp-and-flash
//                          shapes, at 0xB4 it pays 3,000 points (flashMotherShipWreckAndPayThreeThousand), at 0x5A its sprite
//                          codes are set to 0xFF, and at 0 it goes idle and hands over to the round advance (retireMotherShipAndReleaseRoundHold).
//
// SPRITE ENTRY LAYOUT (mechanisms.md). An entry's +0x00 is one coordinate and +0x01 the sprite code
// (shape); 0x30 bytes on, +0x30 is the attribute (colour and flip) and +0x31 the other coordinate. The
// Mother-Ship is two sprites: the second tile uses the next entry (+0x02/+0x03/+0x32/+0x33), placed one
// sprite pitch (16) further along the +0x31 coordinate. Each coordinate is a 16-bit number: the whole
// byte in the entry and a fraction byte in the record (+0x03 for the +0x31 coordinate, +0x05 for +0x00).
//
// LIVE-OUT: memory only -- the record pair and sprite entries, the fifteen swept records, the scoring
// ring, the sound requests, ROUND_TRANSITION_HOLD, HITS_REMAINING, the launch cooldown and the aim toggle.
