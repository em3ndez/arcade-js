//
// ROLE IN THE MACHINE. Each frame of a round, dispatchCollisionPassByEra (0x4E4F) [seen] runs the
// collision pass for the current era; era 1 comes here. Collision work is split over two frames: odd
// FRAME_TICK values run the player's shots against the targets, even values run everything that can
// touch the player's own ship. Era 1 is the one era with a BOMBER -- a two-tile object in the
// era-object bank at 0xA8C0 that soaks hits -- so its even-frame chain splices bomber tests into the
// usual player-contact chain (mechanisms.md, "Era 1 is built differently").
//
// The even-frame chain, in ROM order (steps 3 and 7 start where steps 2 and 6 left their cursors,
// one past their last slot):
//   1. the player's shots against the bomber (destroyFixedTargetHitByShots, 0x4F7E);
//   2. the player against the four enemy-shot slots from 0xA810 (destroyPlayerAndObjectsTouchingIt, 0x5185);
//   3. the player against the craft band that follows at 0xA850 (destroySlotsAndPlayerOnContact, 0x5152);
//   4. while the Mother-Ship is armed, the player against it (ramTestPlayerVsMotherShip, 0x50B1);
//   5. the player against the bomber (destroyFixedTargetReachedByPlayer, 0x507E);
//   6. the player against the bomber's launched object at 0xA8E0 (destroyPlayerAndObjectsTouchingIt);
//   7. the next record, the parachutist at 0xA8F0, marked if the player touches it
//      (markObjectsTouchingPlayer, 0x51B3) -- the touch that collects it.
//
// LIVE-OUT: memory only -- the state bytes the sweeps mark and the scores they post.
