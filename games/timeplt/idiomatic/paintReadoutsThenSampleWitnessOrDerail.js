/** paintReadoutsThenSampleWitnessOrDerail — one arm of the copyright/attract sequence machine that
 * repaints the labelled numeric readouts and refreshes a tile-image tamper witness, guarding the
 * screen twice on the way through.
 *
 * First the copyright line's colours are checked, which derails the machine if any cell is wrong.
 * Then one caption cell is read: unless it still holds its expected glyph the arm hands off to the
 * mother-ship warp/flash handler through its misaligned anti-tamper entry — the "wrong-glyph"
 * derail. On a clean image it queues one caption command, repaints the five labelled numeric
 * readouts, copies one cell's glyph and colour aside as the tamper pair read back later, and steps
 * the sequence's inner index on.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory only. Reached as a table-dispatched tail (nothing static calls it) whose two
 * transfers — the wrong-glyph derail and the sequence step — both leave through the successor the
 * dispatcher parked, and that successor reloads every register it uses before reading one, so no
 * register is live out. */
