/** stepShapeAnimation — count one record's step timer down and refresh that record's shape byte from the
 * step the new count selects.
 *
 * The count is not just a delay: it is also the index into a run of shape bytes, so counting down
 * walks the run backwards and reaching zero stops it. Which run is a second byte of the same
 * record, read through a table of run pointers, so a record can be pointed at a different run
 * without disturbing how far along it has got. A timer already at zero is left alone and nothing
 * at all is written, which is what makes the run stop on its last entry rather than wrap.
 * LIVE-OUT: the timer and the shape byte.
 *
 * ROM 0x323A-0x3251. Grounding: [seen] -- under MAME, one record's shape byte always equalled
 * the byte the run-pointer table at 0x3438 puts at the current count, across six distinct
 * (selector, count) pairs, which is what shows the count is the index and not only a delay.
 *
 * Parameter: `record` -- the object record being animated (IX in the ROM), supplied by the
 * caller. Fields used: +0x08 shape byte, +0x09 step timer, +0x0A run selector. */
