/**
 * Memory-equivalence test for loc_0092 (ROM 0x0092) — the power-on boot entry.
 *
 * loc_0092 checksums the eight program-memory banks (writing a pass tally the play-state gate later
 * requires), then lays down the whole initial machine state: clears work RAM, empties the two command
 * rings, floods the colour map, arms the tile fill, decodes both DIP-switch ports, clears the sprite
 * banks and blanks the lower tile map, enables the vblank interrupt, seeds the high-score table, and
 * finally hands control to the main-loop generator (`jp` into the main loop in the frozen
 * form; a returned generator in the idiomatic form).
 *
 * This is the CYCLE-FREE / memory-equivalence gate. The contract is RAM (dumpState, minus
 * STACK_SCRATCH) with NO register live-out (the routine transfers into the main loop and no register
 * survives as a consumed value), PLUS one dedicated cell:
 *
 *   THE SELF-TEST TALLY (0x8FFF) IS LOAD-BEARING BUT LIVES INSIDE STACK_SCRATCH. The frozen boot sets
 *   SP to 0x9000 and its very first push seats the bank count into 0x8FFF, which the self-test then
 *   increments per matching bank; loc_072d reads 0x8FFF and requires 0x10 (a full pass) to finish
 *   setup. Because 0x8FFF sits in the excluded stack window (0x8FC0-0x8FFF), ramDiffMinusStack cannot
 *   see it, so this test compares it with a DEDICATED arm — otherwise the tally would go unverified.
 *
 * pc/SP/cycles are NOT compared. The frozen tail call into the never-returning main loop is neutralised
 * by stubbing routine 0x020F to a no-op on the frozen side; the idiomatic side builds — but does not
 * run — the main-loop generator, so both stop at boot-complete. The only external inputs besides the
 * fixed program image are the two DIP-switch ports, which every case CRAFTS identically on both sides.
 *
 * Jobs:
 *   1. EQUAL (crafted DSW sweep) — over curated (DSW0, DSW1) pairs oracle == loc_0092 in RAM (−stack)
 *      AND in the dedicated tally cell (both 0x10, a full self-test pass on the intact image).
 *   2. WRITE-SET — the boot's key written cells hold their exact expected values (colour flood + its
 *      one-cell tile-map spill, blank region, config cells, rings, sprite fill, high-score seed, tally).
 *   3. TEETH — a wrong dumped byte MUST be caught by the RAM diff, and a wrong tally by the dedicated
 *      arm (proving that arm load-bearing, since the RAM diff excludes 0x8FFF).
 *
 * Run: node --test games/pooyan/idiomatic/test/equivalence-0092.test.js
