/**
 * Memory-equivalence test for loc_0000 (ROM 0x0000, Pooyan) — the power-on reset vector.
 *
 * loc_0000 disables the vblank NMI latch (0xA180 := 0) and then tails into the boot entry loc_0092,
 * which runs the self-test and lays down the full initial machine state. The reset vector's own write
 * is transient — the boot re-enables the latch before it finishes — so the observable effect of
 * loc_0000 is exactly the boot's final state. This gate therefore runs the whole boot on both sides
 * and compares it, the way loc_0092's own gate does.
 *
 * The contract is RAM (dumpState, minus STACK_SCRATCH) with NO register live-out (control transfers
 * into the main-loop generator), PLUS one dedicated cell:
 *
 *   THE SELF-TEST TALLY (0x8FFF) IS LOAD-BEARING BUT LIVES INSIDE STACK_SCRATCH. The frozen boot
 *   seats the bank count there via its first push and increments it per matching bank; loc_072d later
 *   requires 0x10 (a full pass). Because 0x8FFF sits in the excluded stack window, ramDiffMinusStack
 *   cannot see it, so it is compared with a dedicated arm.
 *
 * pc/SP/cycles are NOT compared. The frozen tail into the never-returning main loop is neutralised by
 * stubbing routine 0x020F to a no-op; the idiomatic side builds — but does not run — the main-loop
 * generator, so both stop at boot-complete. The routine's only inputs are the two DIP-switch ports,
 * so every case CRAFTS them identically on both sides.
 *
 * Jobs:
 *   1. EQUAL (crafted DSW sweep) — oracle == loc_0000 in RAM (−stack) AND in the tally cell.
 *   2. WRITE-SET — the reset+boot's key cells hold their exact expected values, including the NMI
 *      latch left ENABLED (1) after the boot overwrites loc_0000's transient disable.
 *   3. TEETH — a wrong dumped byte (RAM diff) and a wrong tally (dedicated arm) are each CAUGHT.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/pooyan/idiomatic/test/equivalence-0000.test.js
