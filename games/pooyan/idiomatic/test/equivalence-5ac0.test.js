/**
 * Memory-equivalence test for pulseCoinCounter2Latch (ROM 0x5ac0, Pooyan) — coin-counter 2 pulse generator:
 * strobe the LS259 coin-counter latch (bit 4 @ 0xa184) from the pulse count (0x8826) and phase
 * timer (0x8827). No pulses -> ret; fresh pulse -> seed phase 0x30 + raise latch; counting ->
 * dec phase, drop latch at phase 0x18, retire one pulse at phase 0. Structural twin of pulseCoinCounter1Latch.
 *
 * CYCLE-FREE / memory-equivalence gate. pc/SP are NOT compared. The contract has TWO parts:
 *   (a) RAM (dumpState, minus STACK_SCRATCH) — the pulse count + phase cells live in work RAM.
 *   (b) The LS259 latch (m.io.latch) — the routine's real output is a WRITE-ONLY hardware latch
 *       bit that dumpState does NOT capture, so it is compared directly against the oracle clone.
 * There is no register live-out (a coin-counter side-effect routine; no caller reads A/flags).
 *
 * Jobs:
 *   1. EQUAL (crafted, every path) — RAM(−stack) AND the latch match the oracle across the
 *      no-pulse, fresh-pulse, mid-count, drop-point, and retire paths.
 *   2. WRITE-SET — the oracle's RAM writes land only in {count, phase}.
 *   3. TEETH — a wrong phase byte is caught by the RAM diff; a wrong latch bit is caught by the
 *      latch compare (the RAM diff alone is BLIND to the latch, which is why (b) exists).
 *
 * Run: node --test games/pooyan/idiomatic/test/equivalence-5ac0.test.js
