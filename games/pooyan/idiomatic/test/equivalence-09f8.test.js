/**
 * Memory-equivalence test for loc_09f8 (ROM 0x09f8, Pooyan) — "step four object records'
 * animations, then rebuild the sprite display list".
 *
 * The routine sets IX to the object-record table base, walks four records one 0x18 stride
 * apart advancing each one's animation sequence (loc_4006), then tail-calls the per-frame
 * display-list rebuild (loc_02ef). It takes no register inputs and leaves NO register
 * live-out — both stages are void per-frame workers whose whole effect is in RAM.
 *
 * CYCLE-FREE / memory-equivalence gate (docs/decompiler-pipeline). Each case runs the oracle on
 * one FRESH clone and loc_09f8 on another and compares:
 *
 *     RAM (dumpState, minus STACK_SCRATCH).
 *
 * No register live-out is declared or compared (the caller reads none). pc/SP/cycles are NOT
 * compared — the oracle drives them through the dropped call/stack ABI, so SP is seated in the
 * dead stack where its push/call/ret framing lands. The oracle dispatches its m.call sub-routines
 * through the TRANSLATED registry; loc_09f8 imports the idiomatic ones — so the gate compares the
 * translated composition against the idiomatic composition of the same four-then-rebuild shape.
 *
 * Jobs:
 *   1. EQUAL — plain (booted records) and seeded (each record's hold field armed so loc_4006
 *      just decrements it, marking a distinct cell per record) both agree in RAM(−stack).
 *   2. WRITE-SET — the seeded run decrements all four hold fields by one and writes the sprite
 *      display list (loc_02ef ran); documents the four-record coverage + the rebuild delegation.
 *   3. TEETH — a twin that leaves the FOURTH record's hold undecremented is caught by the RAM
 *      diff (proves the loop covers all four records); a twin with a wrong display-list byte is
 *      caught too (proves the rebuild's output is observed).
 *
 * Run: node --test games/pooyan/idiomatic/test/equivalence-09f8.test.js
