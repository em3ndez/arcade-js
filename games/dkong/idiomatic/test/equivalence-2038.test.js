 * Equivalence gate for loc_2038 (ROM 0x2038) — the object sweep's fall-arming block: stamp the
 * initial vertical velocity, blank the two coordinate fractions and the two counters, move the
 * record onto the falling arm, and continue into the still-frozen shared sprite tail at ROM 0x21BA.
 *
 * What this gate covers:
 *   - CAPTURED: an 8000-frame attract run dispatches 0x2038 exactly 42 times; all 42 are replayed
 *     (no sampling) across all 7 record bases the sweep makes live, and the spread is asserted. The
 *     routine has no branch, so the only entry variation is the record base, the accumulator, and
 *     the prior contents of the seven written bytes.
 *   - CRAFTED: the captures are narrow — accumulator 0 on all 42 (so a hardcoded-zero twin is
 *     invisible), +4 already 0 on 41 of 42. The crafted arm is 35 entries (one capture per record
 *     base x 5 accumulator seeds) with all seven written bytes pre-poisoned; both narrownesses are
 *     asserted in the reachability and teeth tests.
 *   - HOW MUCH RUNS: loc_2038 tail-jumps, so every case runs the WHOLE frozen chain below (sprite
 *     copy at 0x21BA, sweep advance at 0x1F8D, rest of the ten-slot sweep) on both sides.
 *   - WHAT IS COMPARED — the memory-equivalence contract for the DISSOLVED form: RAM EXCLUDING the
 *     STACK_SCRATCH window {0x6be0,0x6c00}, the final guest SP, and the forwarded return. loc_2038
 *     direct-calls idiomatic publishBarrelSprite instead of m.call(0x21ba); pc and the register
 *     file are dropped with the frozen bracket, final SP compared instead (a stray push lands in
 *     the excluded window yet still moves SP). Cycles not compared: cycle-free by design.
 *   - RE-ENTRANCY: the chain re-enters 0x2038 (measured 42 -> 44); the hook is frozen before replay
 *     but stays installed and DELEGATES TO THE ORACLE, so nested dispatches are oracle on both sides.
 *   - LIVE-WIRED: the rewrite runs in a real 8000-frame attract run diffed per frame, asserting a
 *     non-zero dispatch count.
 *   - NOT COVERED: attract only (25m); poking BOARD removes 0x2038 rather than reaching new states.
 *     Gameplay entry is untested.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-2038.test.js
