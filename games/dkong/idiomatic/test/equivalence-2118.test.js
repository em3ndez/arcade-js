 * Memory-equivalence gate for loc_2118 (ROM 0x2118), in its DISSOLVED form.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED, and why this file was rewritten. loc_2118 used to end in a `jp` tail on BOTH arms
 * that reached its continuations through the SEAM — `m.call(0x2146)` / `m.call(0x2153)`. Those two
 * continuations (0x2146, 0x2153) are now idiomatic overrides that return normally, so loc_2118
 * DIRECT-CALLS them as plain JS (`loc_2146(m)` / `loc_2153(m)`); the raw addresses are gone. A
 * direct call cannot be intercepted by `m.routines.set`, so the previous harness — which STUBBED
 * both tails on a rehosted machine and compared this routine's head at the hand-off — no longer
 * describes what runs: the rewrite would bypass the stub and run the full real chain while the
 * oracle hit the stub, and every comparison would diverge on writes that are not a defect.
 *
 * SO THIS HARNESS RUNS BOTH SIDES TO COMPLETION. Each replay rehosts the captured entry onto a
 * fresh, override-free Machine (which cannot re-enter the routine through its own tail chain) and
 * runs it two ways: the FROZEN ORACLE loc_2118 on one, the idiomatic loc_2118 on the other. Both
 * carry on through the shared continuation — loc_2146 / loc_2153 / publishBarrelSprite / loc_1f8d
 * and, past that boundary, the still-frozen m.call(0x1f83) — until the object-walk step returns.
 * Neither tail is stubbed. Because the two continuations are memory-equivalent idiomatic rewrites
 * of their frozen twins, the ONLY thing that differs between the two completed runs is this
 * routine's own head, plus the dead stack scratch the frozen side's `call`/`ret` bracket touches
 * that the JS side does not.
 *
 * CONTRACT — the resulting RAM state EXCLUDING the STACK_SCRATCH window, this routine's OWN ordered
 * store sequence (the writes it makes to its record's head fields, isolated by address so the tail
 * chain's writes are not mixed in), the guest stack pointer at completion, and the propagated
 * return value. STACK_SCRATCH is EXCLUDED, not asserted inert: the frozen side reaches loc_1f8d's
 * live `m.call(0x1f83)`, whose `call`/`ret` bracket writes a return address into that window at an
 * SP the JS side never pushes to, so the two runs legitimately differ there and nowhere else. That
 * the exclusion is NECESSARY (some real dispatch diverges inside it) and SUFFICIENT (no real
 * dispatch diverges outside it) is proven by its own test below, so the window is excluded on
 * evidence rather than by habit. The final SP is compared rather than excluded: the frozen and JS
 * chains both leave SP where they found it, so a rewrite that shifts it is visible even though its
 * pushes land in the excluded window.
 *
 * COVERAGE — ATTRACT ONLY. A hook at 0x2118 replays INLINE at every real dispatch of a
 * 12000-frame attract run; the count is cross-checked against a separate pure-oracle counting run,
 * so a replay loop that silently stopped early cannot read as coverage. No gameplay is entered.
 * Each real entry is also replayed under crafted variants poked onto that same real entry (never
 * built from scratch): the exact 223/224 split boundary, which no natural dispatch lands on, and
 * five sprite-code patterns for the low-two-bit mask. The crafted variants pre-pattern the eight
 * written fields with distinct values, so a MISSING store shows in the final RAM as well as a
 * spurious one.
 *
 * Checks: EQUAL over every real dispatch and every crafted variant; SIX broken twins, each pinned
 * to the single check that can see it, with the split-boundary twin additionally shown to ESCAPE
 * every natural entry so the crafted half is documented rather than assumed; and a whole-attract
 * run with the routine wired live, asserting a non-zero dispatch count equal to the independent
 * count and a byte-identical frame trace.
 *
 * TWO TWINS FROM THE OLD HARNESS ARE RETIRED, both because the stub they depended on is gone:
 *  - "spurious push around the tail" asserted that neither side writes STACK_SCRATCH. That
 *    assertion is now false by construction (the frozen chain writes there), and the whole-game SP
 *    guards — idiomatic.test.js "FULL FLIP" and barrel-jump-reset — are the backstop for a stray
 *    push in the dissolved form.
 *  - "tail result dropped" depended on the stub returning a distinctive sentinel; run to
 *    completion the real chain returns `undefined` on every measured path, so a dropped return has
 *    no observable effect and the twin cannot go red. The return-equality assertion itself is KEPT
 *    (it would catch a rewrite that fabricated a return value); only the sentinel-dependent twin is
 *    retired.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-2118.test.js

 * run and diffs the frame trace against the pure-oracle baseline.
 *
 * The baseline is a plain oracle machine, which is the right control precisely because the ONLY
 * routine wired live is 0x2118: its dissolved continuation direct-calls the idiomatic
 * loc_2146/loc_2153/publishBarrelSprite/loc_1f8d (each already a memory-equivalent override), and
 * past loc_1f8d the frozen 0x1f83 subtree runs identically on both.
 *
 * That whole fragment is cycle-free, so its T-state cost is restored at the dispatch — measured by
 * priceDissolved and charged with the program counter set to the walk-step boundary, the point the
 * oracle would next execute. The frozen subtree past the boundary still charges its own T-states on
 * the live run, so adding the oracle's total would double-count it.
