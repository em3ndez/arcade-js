/**
 * Memory-equivalence test for stampTwoTileBands (ROM 0x0D4C) — "stamp two 4-cell tile
 * bands into a video-RAM row": from the row base handed in HL, write tile 0xFD across
 * four cells (base..base+3), skip a 28-cell gap (DE=0x001C), then write tile 0xFC across
 * four cells (base+0x20..base+0x23) — eight video-RAM writes, ending base+36.
 *
 * This is the CYCLE-FREE / memory-equivalence gate (docs/decompiler-pipeline), not the retired strict
 * whole-machine one. The routine WRITES video RAM, so every case uses a FRESH clone per
 * side. The oracle runs on one clone, stampTwoTileBands on another, and they are compared
 * on the go-forward contract:
 *
 *     RAM (dumpState, minus STACK_SCRATCH) only.
 *
 * pc and SP are deliberately NOT compared. The oracle uses m.step + m.ret, so it advances
 * pc to its return target and pops SP+2; both are the modelled step/stack ABI the direct-
 * call layer replaces with a JS return — comparing them would test the control-flow model
 * we drop, not the routine. Memory (the eight video-RAM bytes) is the only live-out: both
 * return sites overwrite HL before reading it (sub_0d43's first call returns to
 * `ld hl,0x7547`; its fall-through return — this routine's second return — lands in
 * loc_0c92 at `ld hl,0x7d86`), B/DE are reloaded and no flag is tested, so HL/B/DE and
 * all flags are dead.
 *
 * REACHABILITY. stampTwoTileBands is board-4-only (100m rivet setup: loc_0c92's board-4
 * arm at 0x0CB6 calls sub_0d43, which calls this routine twice) and attract only plays
 * 25m, so it NEVER dispatches in a plain run. Following the sibling gate (0x0D00), the
 * test forces the real dispatches with an IDENTICAL-BOTH-SIDES board poke (Karl-sanctioned
 * "poke the board state to reach a state for validation"): at frame 100 set GAME_STATE=3,
 * GAME_SUBSTATE=10 (board setup), SUBSTATE_TIMER=1, BOARD=4 (100m rivet). sub_0d43 then
 * fires this routine twice under the vblank NMI (~frame 102) with its two real row bases
 * 0x7687 then 0x7547 — REAL captured entries (real register file, real stack, real board).
 *
 * Jobs:
 *   1. EQUAL (real forced dispatches) — oracle vs stampTwoTileBands on fresh clones of
 *      each captured entry leave identical RAM (−STACK_SCRATCH). Covers both real bases.
 *   2. WRITE-SET (captured) — the oracle's ONLY writes are the eight cells computed from
 *      the captured HL: 0xFD at base..base+3, 0xFC at base+0x20..base+0x23. Documents the
 *      exact footprint (and that nothing else is touched).
 *   3. CRAFTED (generality over the base) — repoint HL to several other video-RAM bases
 *      identically on both sides; oracle == candidate at every base, and the candidate is
 *      read back to prove it genuinely stamped the two bands there (not merely agreed).
 *   4. CRAFTED (overwrite + register/far-RAM independence) — pre-dirty the eight
 *      destination cells to 0xAA identically both sides and confirm both overwrite them;
 *      and poke garbage into B/DE/A and far RAM identically to show the output depends only
 *      on HL. Straight-line, one path — these craft prior contents, not an arm.
 *   5. TEETH — a twin with a WRONG gap (0x20 instead of 0x1C, a plausible "row is 0x20
 *      wide" mistake) shifts the whole second band and MUST be caught, naming base+0x20,
 *      on both a captured and a crafted-dirtied state.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-0d4c.test.js
