/**
 * Equivalence test for reloadObjectBlockAndAdvanceStep (ROM 0x16EE) — a board-advance
 * phase (GAME_SUBSTATE 0x16) that reloads the sprite-object block from a ROM template,
 * patches three record fields, clears a bookkeeping byte, and advances the 0x6388 step.
 *
 * The routine WRITES memory and is NOT a leaf — it calls the landed idiomatic leaf
 * loadSpriteObjectBlock (0x004E) — so it is gated by clone / replay (docs/decompiler-pipeline) with a
 * FRESH clone per case. Its body is almost entirely CONSTANT: the copy overwrites
 * 0x6908..0x692F from the fixed ROM template at 0x388C, then the patches and the 0x62AF
 * clear are fixed values, so the ONLY input-dependent output is the tail `inc (0x6388)`.
 *
 * A long attract run dispatches 0x16ee ZERO times (attract never completes a board, so
 * sub-state 0x16 is never entered), so — exactly as docs/decompiler-pipeline prescribes for arms attract
 * never reaches — the gate is CRAFTED: a real booted attract machine, cloned, with the
 * one input byte (0x6388) surgically poked, then oracle-vs-idiomatic on independent fresh
 * clones. Because the only logic input is 0x6388, the crafted sweep is EXHAUSTIVE:
 *
 *   1. STRUCTURE — on a crafted entry, confirm game-visible RAM (RAM − STACK_SCRATCH) is
 *      identical, and that the oracle actually did the work (block copied from ROM, the
 *      three patches applied, 0x62AF cleared, 0x6388 incremented) so an EQUAL result is not
 *      vacuous. The oracle's own `call 0x004e` / `ret` stack traffic is confined to
 *      STACK_SCRATCH by the crafted SP, so excluding stack cannot mask a real diff.
 *
 *   2. STEP (exhaustive) — sweep 0x6388 0..255 at the entry. Pins the `inc` (result =
 *      (step+1)&0xFF, incl. the 0xFF->0x00 wrap) over every possible step byte, with the
 *      full copy+patch footprint identical each time.
 *
 *   3. TEETH — three twins the gate MUST catch: (a) a WRITE-ORDER corruption that patches
 *      0x690C BEFORE the copy (so the copy's ROM byte 0x00 wins over 0x66), caught naming
 *      0x690C; (b) a dropped 0x6388 `inc`, caught by the STEP sweep naming 0x6388; (c) a
 *      dropped 0x62AF clear, caught naming 0x62AF (the crafted base pokes 0x62AF non-zero
 *      so the routine's unconditional clear is observable, not vacuous).
 *
 *   4. REALISM — hook 0x16ee over a long attract run; replay any real dispatch if one
 *      occurs, else record that attract never reaches this board-advance phase (why
 *      crafted is the gate).
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-16ee.test.js
