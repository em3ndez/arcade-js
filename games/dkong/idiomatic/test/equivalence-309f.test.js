 * Equivalence test for enqueueTask (ROM 0x309F) — the task-ring post primitive.
 *
 * enqueueTask WRITES memory (the ring at 0x60C0–0x60FF and the tail at 0x60B0) and
 * is a subroutine, not a pure leaf, so it is gated by capture / clone / replay
 * (docs/decompiler-pipeline), NOT the exhaustive-leaf pattern:
 *
 *   1. EQUAL (real captured dispatches) — hook 0x309F in a real attract run and
 *      clone the machine at each true dispatch (a FRESH clone per case, since the
 *      routine mutates RAM). For each, run the ORACLE on one clone and enqueueTask
 *      on another and confirm they leave IDENTICAL RAM everywhere game-visible —
 *      the diff is confined to STACK_SCRATCH. That confinement is the whole point:
 *      the oracle models `push hl … pop hl … ret` (writing HL to the stack and
 *      consuming the return address, so its SP/pc move); enqueueTask uses the JS
 *      call stack and models neither, so the ONLY residual difference is the
 *      pushed-HL bytes in dead stack scratch. Every game-visible byte matches.
 *
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted arms) — attract only exercises the no-wrap WRITE arm, so the
 *      OCCUPIED-slot DROP arm and the wrap-around arm are forced by poking one
 *      byte on a real captured entry, IDENTICALLY on both sides (the crafted
 *      entry): DROP (clear the slot's bit 7 → full), WRAP (tail = 0xFE → advance
 *      past 0xFF wraps to 0xC0), plus the base and pre-wrap boundaries.
 *
 *   3. TEETH — a deliberately-broken twin that advances the tail by 1 instead of 2
 *      (a plausible off-by-one) MUST be caught by the captured sweep, naming
 *      TASK_TAIL (0x60B0). A gate that a real corruption slips through is worthless.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-309f.test.js
