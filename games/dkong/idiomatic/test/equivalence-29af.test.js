/**
 * Equivalence test for loc_29af (ROM 0x29AF) — the board-gated resolution of Mario's airborne
 * contact with the 0x6600 objects.
 *
 * The routine is board-gated (mask bit 2 -> board 3), asks the 0x6600 overlap search whether
 * Mario touches a record, and on a touch takes one of three arms decided by MARIO_AIR_PREV_Y
 * against the matched record's OBJ_Y less 4: land on top (writes MARIO_Y + EDGE_REPOSITION_FLAG,
 * skips the caller), kill (clears MARIO_ACTIVE, returns normally), or snap sideways (writes
 * MARIO_X + MARIO_SPRITE_RECORD's X, skips the caller).
 *
 * THE CONTRACT COMPARED HERE is RAM minus STACK_SCRATCH, the boolean return, and — where the
 * board gate OPENED — the register file the frozen continuation reads (A, B, C, DE, H, L, IX,
 * IY). pc/SP are NOT compared: the idiomatic routine replaces the Z80 stack with the JS call
 * stack, so the oracle's pushes and its one- or two-word return are dead scratch (every entry
 * puts SP inside STACK_SCRATCH so they land there). On a CLOSED gate the registers are not
 * compared either, and that is derived rather than convenient: the oracle's closed arm runs the
 * real rst-0x30 vector, which rotates A, counts B down to 0 and loads HL — all three dead,
 * because loc_29af's only caller overwrites A and B (`xor a; ld b,a`) before returning and no
 * continuation reads HL. F is never compared on any arm: both continuations (`xor a` in the
 * caller, `dec a` two levels up) begin by setting flags.
 *
 *   1. REACHABILITY (natural attract) — hook 0x29AF in a plain attract run and record what it
 *      catches. It catches NOTHING: 0 dispatches in 3000 frames, because the caller's own
 *      collision gate never returns normally on board 1. This test asserts that zero; it is a
 *      reachability record, NOT coverage, and the captured/crafted tests below carry the gate.
 *   2. EQUAL (captured, BOARD poked) — attract runs with BOARD poked to 2, 3 and 4 from frame
 *      400 do reach it: 81 / 6 / 175 real dispatches. Every one is classified by the arm the
 *      ORACLE takes, and the replayed sample is every 20th capture plus the first of each arm;
 *      the test asserts the sample covers every arm those runs produced. Those runs produce only
 *      the closed gate (boards 2 and 4) and the no-overlap arm (board 3) — the three ACTING arms
 *      do not occur in them and are carried entirely by test 3.
 *   3. EQUAL (crafted) — crafted entries on a real attract base drive every arm: closed gate,
 *      no overlap, land-on-top, kill, snap-sideways, a touch accepted only through a record's own
 *      extra spans, three entries that drive the decision's 8-bit wraps, and a touch at each of
 *      the six record indices so the record-recovery walk is exercised at every offset.
 *      PLUS the two CLEARANCE BOUNDARIES, straddled a pixel either side. The three-way decision
 *      is a band around the object's contact line, and no entry in the list above comes within
 *      ten of the band's LOWER edge, so a one-pixel error there — the difference between Mario
 *      dying and Mario being nudged sideways — was invisible to every one of them. With the
 *      object at Y 100 the line is at 96 and the arms change between pre-motion Y 90/91 (land ->
 *      side-on) and 109/110 (side-on -> kill); all four entries are replayed against the oracle.
 *      The UPPER edge was already covered, but incidentally rather than by design: two of the
 *      wrap entries happen to land within a pixel of it in wrapped arithmetic. TEETH below
 *      measures both of those facts instead of leaving them as prose.
 *   4. EQUAL (exhaustive, the collapsed branch) — the ROM picks the sideways X through a test on
 *      MARIO_AIR_VX_HI whose two arms are the same function of MARIO_X; the idiomatic routine
 *      keeps one expression. This sweeps all 256 MARIO_X values on both sides of that test
 *      (1024 entries) and pins the collapse against the oracle instead of asserting it.
 *   5. TEETH — eight broken twins the crafted/exhaustive cases MUST catch. Four structural ones:
 *      the contact decision read from MARIO_Y instead of the pre-motion snapshot, the board gate
 *      dropped, the record index taken as the search residue rather than count-minus-residue, and
 *      the sideways snap off by one. Then four one-pixel twins, each moving one edge of the
 *      decision band by one — and for these the test asserts BOTH halves: which of the crafted
 *      entries catch each twin, and which escape it. Measured here: both lower-edge twins escape
 *      every crafted entry that is not a boundary entry, which is the hole the boundary entries
 *      close; both upper-edge twins are caught by a wrap entry as well.
 *
