/**
 * Equivalence test for awardBonusLifeAtThreshold (ROM 0x0350) — grant the
 * once-per-player bonus life when the running score first reaches the operator-set
 * threshold, then repaint the lives/level HUD.
 *
 * sub_0350 is CALLED EVERY FRAME by the main loop, but the score never crosses the
 * bonus threshold during attract, so real captured dispatches only ever exercise
 * the "below threshold, no award" path (BONUS_LIFE_AWARDED stays 0). The award path
 * — set the latch, bump LIVES, and TAIL into drawLivesAndLevel (0x06B8) — is reached
 * only with CRAFTED entries (a real attract-base machine + a surgical poke of the
 * score / threshold / player / latch, identically on both sides).
 *
 * The oracle's tail is `jp 0x06b8` with nothing pushed, so 0x06B8's own `ret`
 * returns on sub_0350's behalf; the two early exits (`ret nz` already-awarded,
 * `ret c` below-threshold) each `ret` too. So the oracle nets exactly ONE
 * caller-return pop on EVERY path, and only READS the stack (popped bytes live in
 * STACK_SCRATCH, excluded by the memory-equivalence contract). The idiomatic
 * routine models no stack (a plain JS return + a direct drawLivesAndLevel call), so
 * runCandidate performs ONE m.ret() after it to line pc + SP up with the oracle.
 *
 *   1. EQUAL (captured) — hook 0x0350 in a real boot/attract run, clone at each
 *      dispatch, and confirm awardBonusLifeAtThreshold == oracle over the real
 *      no-award path (RAM − STACK_SCRATCH, pc, SP), and that the path is genuinely
 *      the no-award one (LIVES untouched).
 *
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted) — poke the score / threshold / player / latch identically on
 *      both sides to reach: the award path for P1 and P2 (both HUD arms — ATTRACT
 *      set skips the paint, ATTRACT clear paints it), the threshold BOUNDARY
 *      (score == threshold awards, proving `>=` not `>`), the already-awarded
 *      early-out, and a below-threshold no-award. Ignored score nibbles carry noise
 *      to pin the nibble masks. Reserve (LIVES-1) is kept 0..6 so the HUD marker
 *      fill stays in mapped video RAM.
 *
 *   3. TEETH — two broken twins, each MUST be caught:
 *      (a) wrong life increment (LIVES + 2) — caught on an award case at 0x6228.
 *      (b) dropped nibble-swap (compares the un-rotated byte) — caught where the
 *          swap flips the award decision (score 0x51 vs the un-swapped 0x15).
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-0350.test.js
