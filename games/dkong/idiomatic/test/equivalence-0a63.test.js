 * Equivalence test for clearScreenAndSelectIntro (ROM 0x0a63) — the credited-game
 * (GAME_STATE 3) board-start sub-state (index 6 of the 0x0702 table) that ticks the
 * rst-0x18 sub-state timer, and on expiry CLEARS the screen (call 0x0874), re-arms
 * SUBSTATE_TIMER (0x6009) to 1, and ADVANCES GAME_SUBSTATE (0x600A) — by 1 to the intro
 * cutscene, or by 2 (skipping the intro to the how-high interlude) when PLAY_INTRO
 * (0x622C) is clear.
 *
 * loc_0a63 is NOT reached in plain attract (headless attract holds GAME_STATE 0); it
 * fires only once a game is credited and started. It reads NO register — its whole
 * behaviour is a function of three memory bytes (SUBSTATE_TIMER, GAME_SUBSTATE,
 * PLAY_INTRO) and it writes only fixed memory (the 0x0874 clear regions + those two
 * counters). So it is validated by MEMORY-equivalence against the frozen oracle on
 * RAM − STACK_SCRATCH, with a FRESH clone per case (it writes memory) — never the full
 * register file, never cycles, and NOT SP/PC (the idiomatic layer replaces the rst-0x18
 * caller-skip and the call/ret stack surgery with the JS stack + a boolean, so the
 * oracle's terminal SP is deliberately not reproduced):
 *
 *   1. REALISM (captured driven dispatch) — drive a coin+start game to GAME_STATE 3 so
 *      the board-start sequence reaches sub-state 6, hook 0x0a63, and clone the machine
 *      at each real dispatch (the natural first-game path: timer expired, PLAY_INTRO set
 *      -> advance to the intro). Run oracle vs clearScreenAndSelectIntro on two fresh
 *      clones and confirm identical RAM (ex-stack).
 *
 *   2. CRAFTED (gate x branch x wrap + footprint) — the arms the natural run never
 *      reaches. Because the routine reads no register, one start state per case fully
 *      determines it: poke SUBSTATE_TIMER (expired == 1 vs still-ticking), PLAY_INTRO
 *      (== 0 vs != 0), and GAME_SUBSTATE (INCLUDING the 8-bit wrap edge 0xFF->0x00), and
 *      paint every cell the clear could touch with a SENTINEL — all identically on both
 *      sides. This pins: the timer gate (skip vs run), the intro branch (+1 vs +2), the
 *      wrapping inc, and the exact clear footprint (a stray/missing write shows
 *      sentinel-vs-fill; a wrong advance shows a lone 0x600A diff).
 *
 *   3. TEETH — three deliberately-broken twins the RAM gate MUST catch: (a) an INVERTED
 *      intro branch (extra advance when PLAY_INTRO is SET) — caught at 0x600A; (b) a
 *      MISSING timer gate (body runs even while the timer is still ticking) — caught at
 *      0x600A/0x6009 on a not-yet-expired entry; and (c) a SKIP-CLEAR (advance without
 *      blanking the screen) — caught on a sentinel entry, where a clear region the
 *      oracle filled still holds the sentinel.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-0a63.test.js
