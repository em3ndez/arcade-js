/**
 * Equivalence test for loc_1bec (ROM 0x1BEC) — the airborne block's join point: one frame of
 * ballistic motion on the caller's actor record, then the airborne handler at ROM 0x1C05.
 *
 * The idiomatic routine direct-calls stepBallisticMotion (already idiomatic) and hands the
 * frame on with m.call(0x1C05), which is still the frozen oracle. Because the ENTIRE 0x1C05
 * tail runs on both sides, this gate is stronger than a leaf gate: the ballistic step's
 * register live-out is settled for free — any register the handler chain really consumes
 * would surface as a memory/pc/SP difference here.
 *
 *   0. REACHABILITY, honestly — PLAIN ATTRACT NEVER DISPATCHES 0x1BEC (asserted: 0 over 2000
 *      attract frames). The demo only jumps mid-girder, where the position gate at ROM 0x241F
 *      answers "not at a boundary" and the block above tail-jumps straight to 0x1C05. So the
 *      captured dispatches come from a REAL CREDITED GAME instead: coin, 1-player start, then
 *      a single poke of Mario's starting spot, after which the game's own engine carries him
 *      airborne into the boundary region that routes through here. Three spots — upper-left,
 *      far-left, far-right — yield 57 real dispatches, every one with the record pointer on
 *      Mario's record at 0x6200.
 *
 *   1. EQUAL (real dispatches) — clone each real entry, run oracle vs loc_1bec on independent
 *      fresh clones, and compare RAM − STACK_SCRATCH, pc, SP and the propagated return value.
 *      Non-vacuity is pinned too: the oracle really does step the record (the airborne-frame
 *      counter advances and the fixed-point vertical coordinate moves).
 *
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted handler arms) — real captures all arrive in one phase (fall-height
 *      check armed, counter freshly zeroed), so the handler's other exits are crafted on a
 *      real captured state, IDENTICALLY on both sides, by poking only the phase cells: the
 *      plain-continue exit, the exit that arms the land-check phase, and the fatal-fall entry
 *      the clamp block above reaches by its skip branch. Each arm is confirmed to have really
 *      changed which handler exit fires, by wrapping the exit addresses on a probe clone.
 *
 *   3. EQUAL (crafted sweep) — 1085 position/phase combinations over a real captured state
 *      (five columns × every vertical pixel), which also drives the landing exit the poked
 *      runs never reach. All identical on the same contract.
 *
 *   4. TEETH — three deliberately-broken twins the gate MUST catch: a dropped ballistic step,
 *      an order swap (handler before the step), and a wrong tail target. The last two are
 *      baited on the counter-driven arm, not on a raw capture: with the fall-height check
 *      already armed — the phase every real dispatch arrives in — the handler branches away
 *      before reading anything the step touched, so an order swap is genuinely invisible
 *      there. Measured, not assumed: the swap twin escapes a raw capture and is caught the
 *      moment the counter decides the frame.
 *
