/**
 * Equivalence gate for loc_20a2 (ROM 0x20A2) — the arm that decides whether an object whose fall
 * has just been arrested also turns round, before the frozen bounce tail at ROM 0x20C3.
 *
 * WHAT IS COMPARED — the memory-equivalence contract. This routine's tail m.calls were dissolved to
 * direct idiomatic calls (m.call(0x20b5)->loc_20b5, m.call(0x20c3)->loc_20c3), so the candidate no
 * longer performs the oracle's guest-stack pushes or charges its cycles. The contract is therefore
 * RAM MINUS STACK_SCRATCH, plus the propagated return value, and nothing else:
 *   - RAM, STACK_SCRATCH EXCLUDED. The game-visible memory must be byte-identical; the dead guest-
 *     stack window is where the dissolved pushes legitimately diverge and is not part of the contract.
 *   - the propagated return value.
 * A fault is treated as a result, not as a crashed run: both sides are run inside a catch and the
 * thrown message is part of the comparison, so a crafted entry that walks the frozen tail off a
 * table reports as a breach instead of killing the gate.
 * NOT compared — all seam artifacts of the dissolution, excluded by the contract:
 *   - the whole ordered WRITE SEQUENCE. The oracle's writes include its m.call guest-stack pushes,
 *     which the direct call omits; the write order is not part of the memory-eq contract.
 *   - the exit REGISTER FILE, SP included. This routine writes no register (LIVE-OUT: memory + return
 *     only), so there is no register live-out; SP is guarded by the whole-game SP-inertness tests
 *     (idiomatic.test.js, barrel-jump-reset), not here.
 *   - pc and CYCLES: what cycle-free code gives up. The cycle difference is measured for visibility
 *     (test 2) but not asserted, and the live run is driven by an engine that does not consult it.
 *
 *   0. REACHABILITY — measured first, because a live arm against an unreached routine proves
 *      nothing. All THREE code paths are dispatched naturally during attract; the test asserts the
 *      count, that all three paths occur, the object rows attract delivers, and that the number of
 *      kept entries equals the number of dispatches, i.e. nothing is sampled. The path label is
 *      derived from the ORACLE's own outgoing jump target plus the kind byte in the ENTRY state,
 *      never from the candidate, so the coverage claim is not circular. There are three paths and
 *      only two jump targets, which is why the target alone is not the label.
 *   1. EQUAL (captured) — replayed INLINE at each dispatch during the attract run itself: clone,
 *      run both sides, compare, discard. Every dispatch, no sampling, O(1) live memory.
 *   2. CYCLES — the per-path cycle difference between oracle and candidate, measured rather than
 *      assumed. It is path-dependent — three paths, three different constants — which is precisely
 *      why the live run below uses the cycle-free engine instead of charging a constant back.
 *   3. LIVE (whole attract) — the live-out measurement: 12000 attract frames under runCycleFree with
 *      the candidate wired at 0x20A2, its per-frame trace diffed against a baseline that differs in
 *      exactly ONE thing — the body behind the same override, the same seam, the same engine. The
 *      NMI is fired on control flow at the vblank poll, so the candidate's missing cycles cannot
 *      shift it and there is nothing to charge back. Asserts the dispatch count is non-zero and
 *      identical on both sides.
 *      COVERAGE: attract only. Gameplay is not exercised live, and no other board exists for this
 *      cluster — the walk at ROM 0x1F72 returns at once unless BOARD is 1.
 *   4. EQUAL (crafted) — the entry shapes attract never delivers: the clearance boundary and either
 *      side of it, the byte wrap near the top of the screen, four kind values on a geometry that
 *      would otherwise not turn, Mario at both extremes of a byte, and a nudged record base. Each
 *      is a REAL captured state with one surgical poke applied identically to both sides.
 *   5. OBSERVED EFFECT (oracle only, not an equivalence check) — runs the ORACLE in plain attract
 *      and watches what happens to each record's horizontal step and launch speed across the
 *      dispatch. This is what the routine's role line rests on: three reads and a jump can say
 *      which tail runs, never what a tail does. Over 12000 frames, all 68 dispatches:
 *        the two turn paths (64) — the horizontal step goes -96 -> +256, or +96 -> -256, in
 *                                  1/256 px per frame: reversed, and set to exactly one whole pixel.
 *        the no-turn path (4)    — the step is left exactly as it was, +96 -> +96.
 *      The launch speed is replaced on all 68. A turn path that had left the step alone, or a
 *      no-turn path that had changed it, would have killed the role line.
 *      WHERE THE NO-TURN ARM FIRES: all 4 of its dispatches land on the lowest object rows the
 *      routine is reached at (235 and 236, against 104/137/170/203 for the rest), with Mario above
 *      the object every time — so what that arm is FOR is observed, not explained.
 *   6. TEETH — seven broken twins, plus a live-wired twin proving the LIVE arm is not inert. The
 *      test reports which twins the captured replay catches and which only a crafted entry reaches.
 *
 * THE ENTROPY PIN IS DELIBERATELY NOT INSTALLED. Pinned, attract dispatches 0x20A2 zero times in
 * 4000 frames; the routine is only reached on the unpinned RNG. Test 0 asserts the unpinned count,
 * so this cannot quietly become a zero-dispatch gate.
 *
 * ON RE-ENTRY. This routine's tail runs the rest of the object walk, which dispatches 0x20A2 again
 * for later slots, and a clone carries the source machine's override map. A single re-entry guard
 * makes the nested dispatches plain oracle delegates on BOTH sides, so each comparison is exactly
 * one candidate dispatch with the oracle underneath it.
 *
