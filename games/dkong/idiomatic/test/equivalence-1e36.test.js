 * Equivalence test for loc_1e36 (ROM 0x1E36) — stamp the 0x6A30 sprite record + cue
 * the board-gated sound latch 0x6085.
 *
 * loc_1e36 WRITES memory (record 0x6A30..0x6A33 and, when the board gate is open,
 * SND_TRIGGER[5] at 0x6085) and is NOT a leaf (it calls boardBitGate / the oracle's
 * `rst 0x30`), so it is gated by capture / clone / replay (docs/decompiler-pipeline) with a FRESH clone
 * per case. Its only branch is the board gate; A, B, C are stored verbatim. The gate
 * depends solely on BOARD (0x6227) — mask A = 0x05 opens on 25m (1) and 75m (3):
 *
 *   1. REALISM (real captured dispatch) — attract dispatches 0x1e36 on 25m (BOARD 1,
 *      gate OPEN). Run the ORACLE on one clone and loc_1e36 on another and confirm
 *      every game-visible byte matches — the diff is confined to STACK_SCRATCH. That
 *      confinement is the whole point: the oracle models `push … rst 0x30 … ret`
 *      (writing the stack + consuming a return address, so its SP/pc move); loc_1e36
 *      uses the JS call stack and models neither, so the ONLY residual difference is
 *      stack-scratch bytes. SP/pc must be unchanged for the idiomatic side.
 *
 *   2. BOARD (exhaustive crafted) — the gate is the routine's only logic and attract
 *      only exercises BOARD 1, so on a real captured entry poke BOARD to EVERY byte
 *      0..255 identically on both sides and compare game-visible RAM. This pins the
 *      50m/100m CLOSED arms (no 0x6085 write) that attract never reaches, plus the full
 *      rotate behaviour of the mask-0x05 gate (open on 1/3/9/11/…, closed elsewhere).
 *
 *   3. A/B/C record (edge crafted) — the four stored bytes and their order, swept over
 *      distinct edge values with the gate both open (BOARD 1) and closed (BOARD 2), so
 *      a byte-order or wrong-attribute error would show.
 *
 *   4. TEETH — two twins the sweeps MUST catch: (a) one that DROPS the gate (writes
 *      0x6085 unconditionally) is caught by the BOARD sweep at a closed board, naming
 *      0x6085; (b) one that stores the record in SWAPPED order (C,B,A) is caught by the
 *      A/B/C sweep, naming 0x6A30.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-1e36.test.js
