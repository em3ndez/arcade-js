/**
 * Memory-equivalence test for loc_0cdf (ROM 0x0CDF) — the 50m (board 2, conveyors)
 * board-setup arm. It selects the 50m colour/palette bank (the two ls259 palette-bank
 * output latches -> 01: 0x7d86 = 1, 0x7d87 = 0), selects the 50m background tune
 * (SND_BGM = 0x09), points DE at the 50m conveyor layout table (ROM 0x3B5D), and runs
 * the shared draw + setup tail loc_0cc6 (ROM 0x0CC6).
 *
 * This is the CYCLE-FREE / memory-equivalence gate (docs/decompiler-pipeline), not the
 * retired strict whole-machine one. The arm WRITES memory through the tail and the setup
 * continuation carries state, so every case uses a FRESH clone per side and the two are
 * compared on the go-forward contract:
 *
 *     RAM (dumpState, minus STACK_SCRATCH), PLUS the palette-bank output latch.
 *
 * The palette-bank latch is I/O device state (io.paletteBank), NOT part of dumpState
 * (work + sprite + video RAM only) — the display reads it to pick its colour set. It is
 * checked directly, alongside the RAM diff, so the arm's palette-bank job is not blind.
 *
 * pc and SP are deliberately NOT compared: the oracle models its CALL/RET brackets with
 * push16/step/ret (return addresses left in the dead stack region), the plumbing the
 * direct-call layer replaces with a JS return. Those pushes land inside STACK_SCRATCH, so
 * they are masked by the contract. A/HL and all flags are dead ABI: loc_0c92 (the caller)
 * reads no return value. DE is set only as a live-IN handed to the tail, not a live-out of
 * this arm.
 *
 * REACHABILITY. loc_0cdf is 50m-only: loc_0c92 branches to it exactly when BOARD == 2.
 * Attract plays 25m, so it NEVER dispatches in a plain run. Following the sanctioned
 * "poke the board state to reach a state for validation", the test forces the real
 * dispatch with an IDENTICAL-BOTH-SIDES board-2 poke at frame 100 (GAME_STATE=3,
 * GAME_SUBSTATE=0x0A board-setup, SUBSTATE_TIMER=1, BOARD=2); loc_0c92 then m.call's
 * 0x0CDF once (~frame 102) under the vblank NMI, giving a REAL captured entry (real
 * register file, real stack).
 *
 * Jobs:
 *   1. EQUAL (real forced dispatch) — oracle vs loc_0cdf on fresh clones of the real
 *      board-2 entry leave identical RAM (−STACK_SCRATCH) and identical palette bank.
 *      Both entry clones are pre-seeded with a distinct sentinel palette bank so the
 *      match at bank 1 proves the latch writes actually happened (not an unchanged byte).
 *      Non-vacuous: the oracle side shows the whole chain ran — SND_BGM = 0x09, palette
 *      bank = 1, and the setup continuation armed SUBSTATE_TIMER = 0x40. The dead stack
 *      traffic is proven load-bearing to the mask (stackDiffs > 0), and entry SP sits in
 *      STACK_SCRATCH so the exclusion is sound.
 *   2. TEETH (music) — a twin that writes the WRONG tune (0x0A) MUST be caught at SND_BGM.
 *   3. TEETH (palette) — a twin that DROPS the palette-bank latch writes leaves the
 *      sentinel bank in place; MUST be caught at the palette-bank latch. This proves the
 *      latch writes are load-bearing (they are invisible to the RAM diff).
 *   4. TEETH (layout/DE) — a twin that points DE at the 75m table (0x3BE5) draws a
 *      DIFFERENT board; MUST be caught in the drawn tilemap. This proves the DE live-in
 *      marshalling is load-bearing.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-0cdf.test.js
