 * Equivalence gate for stepBarrelLeft (ROM 0x1FEF) — the −X arm of the barrel walk: swap the
 * register file to its alternate bank, stage the two direction constants the shared roll tail
 * consumes (slope-step selector 255, orientation direction 4), and decrement this barrel's X.
 *
 * DISSOLVED FORM: stepBarrelLeft direct-calls the idiomatic advanceRollingBarrel (the dissolved
 * body of ROM 0x1FF6) instead of m.call(0x1FF6), so the whole fragment above the frozen object-walk
 * step at ROM 0x1F83 runs cycle-free; the constants and the decrement are proven by the finished
 * work of the whole chain, run on both sides.
 *
 * What this gate covers:
 *   - CAPTURED: a 3000-frame attract run dispatches 0x1FEF 1967 times across 7 records; all are
 *     replayed (no sampling) and distinct entry shapes counted.
 *   - CRAFTED: re-seed X across all 256 values on a real captured base, keeping its real banks and
 *     stack so the frozen chain stays well-defined; each of the four teeth is caught here.
 *   - WHAT IS COMPARED — the memory-equivalence contract for the DISSOLVED form: RAM EXCLUDING the
 *     STACK_SCRATCH window {0x6be0,0x6c00}, the final guest SP, and the forwarded return. pc and the
 *     register file are dropped with the frozen call bracket that made them comparable; final SP is
 *     kept (a stray push in the rewrite lands in the excluded window yet still moves SP). Cycles are
 *     not compared: the rewrite is cycle-free.
 *   - RE-ENTRANCY: the chain re-enters 0x1FEF; the hook is frozen before replay but stays installed
 *     and DELEGATES TO THE ORACLE, so nested dispatches are oracle on both sides.
 *   - LIVE-OUT: the only dropped value is the flags the decrement defines; scrambled at the 0x1FF6
 *     boundary across the run the trace stays byte-identical, so the tail redefines them first.
 *   - NOT COVERED: attract only (25m). Credited gameplay entry is untested.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-1fef.test.js
