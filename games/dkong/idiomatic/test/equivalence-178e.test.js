 * Equivalence test for advanceToNextBoard (ROM 0x178E) — the board-sequence advance.
 *
 * advanceToNextBoard WRITES memory (BOARD_SEQ_PTR / BOARD / the task ring / 0x6388 /
 * SUBSTATE_TIMER / GAME_SUBSTATE) and calls two sub-routines, so it is gated by
 * capture / clone / replay (docs/decompiler-pipeline), NOT the exhaustive-leaf pattern. It is dispatched
 * only during board-advance (GAME_STATE == 3, GAME_SUBSTATE == 0x16, loc_1615's rst-0x28
 * table, 0x6388 selector at this step) — a state a bounded attract run never reaches — so
 * its real entries are FORCED with an identical-both-sides poke (Karl's sanctioned "poke
 * the board state to reach a state for validation", applied to oracle and candidate
 * alike, so equivalence is preserved):
 *
 *   1. EQUAL (forced real dispatches) — hold GAME_STATE=3 / GAME_SUBSTATE=0x16 / BOARD
 *      bit0 / the 0x6388 selector / SUBSTATE_TIMER=1 across a window so 0x178E dispatches
 *      AND runs its body every frame (the pointer walks a fresh board index each time).
 *      Clone the machine at each true dispatch (a FRESH clone per case — the routine
 *      mutates RAM), run the ORACLE on one clone and advanceToNextBoard on another, and
 *      confirm IDENTICAL RAM everywhere game-visible — the only tolerated residue is in
 *      STACK_SCRATCH (the oracle models push/ret; the idiomatic call does not). Also
 *      confirm advanceToNextBoard leaves SP + pc untouched (it models no stack).
 *
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted arms) — the three data-dependent paths, each poked one variable
 *      identically on both sides on a real captured entry (docs/decompiler-pipeline crafted entry):
 *        - SKIP    : SUBSTATE_TIMER=5 → the rst-0x18 gate has not expired → early return.
 *        - WALK    : SUBSTATE_TIMER=1, BOARD_SEQ_PTR=0x3A65 → +1=0x3A66 is a board byte.
 *        - WRAP    : SUBSTATE_TIMER=1, BOARD_SEQ_PTR=0x3A78 → +1=0x3A79 is the 0x7F
 *                    terminator → reload 0x3A73 (the level-loop wrap).
 *
 *   3. TEETH — a deliberately-broken twin that walks the pointer by 2 instead of 1 (a
 *      plausible off-by-one, the analogue of enqueueTask's tail-advance teeth) MUST be
 *      caught: it publishes the wrong BOARD and leaves BOARD_SEQ_PTR wrong. A gate a real
 *      board-advance corruption slips through is worthless.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-178e.test.js
