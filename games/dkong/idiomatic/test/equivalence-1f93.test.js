/**
 * advanceBarrelMotion — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x1F93: the active-slot
 * branch pick of the OBJ_ARRAY_67 object walk.
 * GATE:  captured + crafted + live, ATTRACT ONLY. Every real dispatch in a 6000-frame attract
 *        run is replayed inline — no sampling — with the branch the rewrite picks compared
 *        against the branch the ORACLE picks. Three crafted arms cover the field values
 *        attract never presents. Record slots 8-9, credited gameplay, two-player and boards
 *        2-4 are NOT covered.
 *
 * The routine reads two record bytes and jumps to one of five still-frozen branches. It
 * writes nothing, so almost everything observable about it is WHICH branch it picked —
 * which is why the checks below pin the branch choice directly as well as through the RAM
 * the branch then writes.
 *
 * CONTRACT COMPARED HERE: the work/sprite/video state dump minus STACK_SCRATCH plus the
 * return value — the required memory-equivalence contract — and, as EXTRAS that legitimately
 * hold for this routine, the STACK_SCRATCH window itself, pc, SP and the FULL register file.
 * The extras hold for a derivable reason: the rewrite keeps the oracle's tail dispatch, so
 * the frozen branch chain performs every stack operation the oracle performs (neither side
 * pushes anything of its own — both exits are jumps) and runs the whole rest of the walk
 * before returning through the same `ret`. Asserting them is free teeth rather than a false
 * contract. The one thing the rewrite really drops is the accumulator and the flags at the
 * instant the branch is entered, which test 4 measures rather than assumes.
 *
 * WHY THE ENTRIES ARE REHOSTED AND NOT CLONED. A capture comes from a machine carrying the
 * capturing override and clone() reruns the constructor with the same assets, so a clone
 * carries it too — and this routine's branch chain RE-ENTERS 0x1F93 for the walk's remaining
 * slots, so replaying on a clone would re-trigger the hook and clone again without bound.
 * Every entry is rehosted into a FRESH override-free Machine instead. That also makes the
 * nested re-entries run the pure oracle on BOTH sides, which is what isolates the single
 * outermost dispatch under test.
 *
 * WHAT EACH TEST ACTUALLY COVERS — read this before trusting a green run:
 *
 *   1. CAPTURED (real dispatches). 0x1F93 is dispatched 11026 times in a 6000-frame attract
 *      run, first at frame 613, and ALL 11026 are replayed inline — clone-free, O(1) memory,
 *      no sampling, so there is no sampling policy to be wrong about. Asserted rather than
 *      merely reported: all five branches are reached by real dispatches, and at least one
 *      real dispatch carries select==1 over a NON-ZERO mode byte (41 do), which is what lets
 *      the routine's header claim the select byte's priority is covered by captures. Each
 *      replay also compares the branch the rewrite picks against the branch the ORACLE picks
 *      — both observed the same way, by stubbing all five targets on a rehost — so the arm
 *      label is never derived from the candidate. ATTRACT ONLY: 25m, record slots 0-7 of the
 *      ten, single-player. Slots 8-9, gameplay, two-player and boards 2-4 are NOT covered.
 *
 *   2. CRAFTED (the field values attract never presents). Three arms, each poking only the
 *      one or two record bytes on a REAL capture — coherent stack, caller frames, shadow
 *      register set and live loop state all left alone: select 1 against mode bits 7 (the
 *      priority against a mode BIT, where attract only supplies it against 8), select 2
 *      (which is what separates "equal to 1" from "non-zero"), and mode 6 (bits 1 and 2 set
 *      together). Each asserts, from the ORACLE's own outgoing dispatch, that the poke
 *      actually reached the branch it exists for, so a poke that changed nothing fails as
 *      vacuous rather than passing.
 *
 *   3. TEETH — five deliberately-broken twins, each of which MUST be caught, and caught by
 *      the half this file says: mode bit 1 tested before bit 0; mode bit 2 not tested at
 *      all; the mode bits read out of the select field; the select tested for non-zero
 *      instead of ==1; and mode bit 2 tested before bit 1. The last two escape ALL 11026
 *      real captures — attract never presents a select outside {0,1} nor bits 1 and 2
 *      together — and are caught only by a crafted arm. That is asserted in BOTH directions:
 *      a twin claimed to be crafted-only must be caught by zero captures, so a twin quietly
 *      migrating between the halves fails instead of passing.
 *
 *   4. LIVE-OUT, poisoned AT THE SEAM. An all-oracle attract run with the accumulator and
 *      all eight flags inverted at the exact instant the branch is dispatched — the exact
 *      state this rewrite drops, at the exact point it drops it. Poisoning after the
 *      dispatch instead would prove only that the frozen chain overwrote things. Cycle-
 *      identical to the baseline by construction, and the poison count is asserted equal to
 *      the dispatch count so no dispatch escapes it.
 *
 *   5. LIVE (whole-machine). The rewrite wired at 0x1F93 for the same 6000-frame run,
 *      compared frame by frame against the baseline. THE ORACLE'S HEAD COST IS RESTORED, and
 *      only the head: the rewrite keeps the oracle's tail dispatch, so the frozen chain is
 *      already charging its own cycles and adding the oracle's total would double-count it.
 *      The head is priced per dispatch by running the oracle on a rehost with the five
 *      branches STUBBED — non-recursive and O(1). The five head costs (33, 66, 80, 94 and
 *      104 T-states) are reported by the run.
 *
 * THE BASELINE IS NOT AN OVERRIDE-FREE MACHINE. It carries a DELEGATING hook at 0x1F93, so
 * the call-bracket seam is installed on both sides and the only difference between the
 * baseline and a live run is which function sits at that one address.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-1f93.test.js

// -- 4. LIVE-OUT: poison at the seam ------------------------------------------

/**
 * POISON AT THE SEAM. The whole run is the ORACLE, except that the accumulator and all
 * eight flags are scrambled at the exact instant it hands the record to a branch — i.e.
 * exactly the state this rewrite drops, at exactly the moment it drops it. Poisoning
 * AFTER the dispatch would measure the wrong boundary: by then the whole frozen branch
 * chain has run and would have overwritten those registers itself.
 *
 * Cycle-identical to the baseline by construction (the oracle charges everything), so no
 * cycle restoration is involved and nothing but the register drop is being measured. The
 * poisoning wrapper is installed ONCE on the machine rather than per dispatch; a nested
 * re-entry re-arms it, so every dispatch is poisoned exactly once — asserted, not assumed.
