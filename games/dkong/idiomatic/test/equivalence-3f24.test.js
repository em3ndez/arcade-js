 * Equivalence test for stampFixedTilePair (ROM 0x3F24) — the fixed two-tile stamp.
 *
 * sub_3f24 WRITES memory (two video-RAM tilemap cells) but takes NO INPUTS: it
 * loads HL/DE from literals and always writes 0x9F to 0x74AF and 0x9E to 0x748F,
 * with no branches. So it is a CONSTANT action, gated by capture / clone / replay
 * (docs/decompiler-pipeline) plus crafts that prove the constancy — NOT the exhaustive-leaf pattern:
 *
 *   1. EQUAL (real captured dispatches) — hook 0x3F24 in a real attract run and
 *      clone the machine at each true dispatch (loc_07cb's countdown repaint calls
 *      it via m.call; the construction-time override catches that). A FRESH clone
 *      per case (the routine mutates RAM). For each, run the ORACLE on one clone
 *      and stampFixedTilePair on another and confirm they leave IDENTICAL RAM
 *      everywhere game-visible. This routine pushes nothing, so — unlike a
 *      push/pop leaf — there is not even stack-scratch residue: the dumps match to
 *      the byte. Also confirm (a) the oracle touches ONLY 0x74AF/0x748F, which is
 *      what licenses the memory-only LIVE-OUT, and (b) the idiomatic form leaves
 *      SP and pc unchanged (the dropped `ret` model).
 *
 *   2. EQUAL (input-independence crafts) — the routine ignores all state, so it is
 *      proven so: take a real captured entry and, IDENTICALLY on both sides, poke
 *      the target cells to junk (0x00/0xFF), scramble the registers HL/DE/A/B/C the
 *      oracle's assembly touches, and dirty unrelated RAM. Oracle vs idiomatic must
 *      still match game-visible RAM, and the two cells must always end 0x9F/0x9E —
 *      catching any accidental dependence on register or memory state.
 *
 *   3. TEETH — a deliberately-broken twin that writes the second cell 0x20 ABOVE
 *      instead of below (0x74CF, a plausible `hl += 0x20` sign flip — the exact trap
 *      the oracle header warns about) MUST be caught by the captured sweep, naming
 *      the diverging tilemap cell. A gate a wrong target address slips through is
 *      worthless.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-3f24.test.js
