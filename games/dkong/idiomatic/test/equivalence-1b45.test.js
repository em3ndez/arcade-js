/**
 * Equivalence test for loc_1b45 (ROM 0x1B45) — the "holding Up -> climb up" input guard.
 *
 * loc_1b45 branches on ONE byte, P1_INPUT (0x6010), testing its UP bit (bit 2 = 0x04):
 *   - bit 2 SET (Up held): hand off to the climb-UP driver climbMarioUp, which paces and
 *     advances Mario's ladder climb this frame.
 *   - bit 2 CLEAR (Up not held): do nothing and return; no memory is written.
 * climbMarioUp is already idiomatic and direct-called; the oracle reaches it by `m.call`,
 * so this gate also composes climbMarioUp's own equivalence (and its callees').
 *
 * The oracle enters by a tail-call from loc_1b38, takes no register live-in it does not
 * immediately overwrite, and both paths net exactly ONE `ret`: the Up arm tail-jumps into
 * 0x1D03 whose chain ends in a single `ret` (returning on the caller's behalf), and the
 * idle arm does its own `ret`. The idiomatic routine models no stack (a direct call + a
 * plain JS return), so the harness performs ONE m.ret() on the candidate clone after the
 * call to line pc + SP up with the oracle. Transient push/pop the oracle's deeper callees
 * do lands in STACK_SCRATCH, excluded by the memory-equivalence contract (RAM −
 * STACK_SCRATCH + pc + SP; live-out is memory-only).
 *
 *   1. EQUAL (real dispatches) — hook 0x1B45 in a real attract run and compare oracle vs
 *      candidate on RAM + pc + SP for every captured entry. The upstream input dispatch only
 *      routes here mid-climb, and the attract demo holds Up whenever it does, so every real
 *      dispatch takes the climb arm; the idle arm (Up clear) is covered by the crafted sweep.
 *
 *   2. EQUAL (input sweep) — from a real captured state, sweep P1_INPUT over all 256 values,
 *      comparing both sides each time. This pins the exact bit-2 test: exactly the 128
 *      values with bit 2 set take the climb arm. Non-vacuity: a crafted timer==0 entry on
 *      the Up arm is shown to run the climb (reloads the move-step timer to 4 and moves
 *      MARIO_Y up by two), and an idle entry is shown to write nothing.
 *
 *   3. TEETH — two deliberately-broken twins, each MUST be caught:
 *      (a) inverted-guard — climbs when Up is NOT held and idles when it is; caught on an
 *          Up-held timer==0 entry (oracle climbs and writes, twin idles).
 *      (b) wrong-bit — tests the LEFT bit (bit 1) instead of the UP bit (bit 2); caught on
 *          a control word with only bit 2 set (oracle climbs, twin idles).
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-1b45.test.js
