/**
 * Equivalence test for driveBarrelRelease (ROM 0x2C8F) — the 25m barrel-release entry: a board gate, an
 * alive gate, two scratch-bit gates, and a ten-record scan of OBJ_ARRAY_67 for a free barrel
 * slot, ending in one of two tail hand-offs (advanceBarrelRelease / releaseBarrelIntoFreeSlot).
 *
 * The oracle reaches its callees through the machine's address registry (`m.call`), which
 * resolves each to its frozen translated copy; those subtrees push return brackets and thread
 * multi-way `ret`s. driveBarrelRelease DIRECT-calls the four idiomatic callees (each memory-equivalent to
 * its own oracle, gated separately) and models no stack. Both sides reach identical work RAM;
 * the only residual difference is the dead STACK_SCRATCH the oracle's push/ret churn writes,
 * excluded by the memory-equivalence contract.
 *
 * WHY NOT pc/SP: cycle-free idiomatic code models the Z80 `ret` as the JS return, so pc/SP
 * cannot match by construction and comparing them would measure the absent `ret`, not the
 * routine. The contract here is RAM − STACK_SCRATCH, the return value, and the two registers
 * the routine hands to the slot claim.
 *
 *   0. REACHABILITY — how many real 0x2C8F dispatches a plain attract run produces, and which
 *      arms they land on.
 *   1. EQUAL (captured) — hook 0x2C8F in a real attract run and clone at each dispatch under a
 *      stated sampling policy: EVERY 20th dispatch PLUS the first at each distinct entry shape
 *      (board / alive / the two gate bits / the arm the scan takes). The test asserts in-run
 *      that the replayed sample covers every shape the run saw. Each sample is replayed oracle
 *      vs driveBarrelRelease on byte-identical fresh clones.
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted) — the arms a 25m attract run cannot reach, poked identically on both
 *      sides onto a REAL captured entry: the board gate closed on 50m/75m/100m, a full
 *      ten-record scan that finds nothing free, claims at slots 8 and 9 (attract reached only
 *      0..7), and two records that must be SKIPPED for being already claimed (bit 1) rather
 *      than in motion (bit 0).
 *   3. TEETH — three broken twins, each MUST be caught: one that drops the "already claimed"
 *      bit-1 test, one that hands the slot claim the walked index instead of the countdown, and
 *      one that swaps the two gate bytes.
 *
 * COVERAGE THIS DOES NOT CLAIM: attract only, plus pokes on top of attract state. No credited
 * game, no 50m/75m/100m play (those boards are reached only by poking BOARD, which closes the
 * routine's own gate — which is exactly the arm being tested).
 *
 * MEASURED (these numbers used to sit in the routine's own header, which R21 no longer allows to
 * state them):
 *   • 2614 real 0x2C8F dispatches in 6000 attract frames, across 11 DISTINCT entry shapes.
 *   • 141 of them replayed — every 20th dispatch plus the first of each shape — with the test
 *     asserting in-run that the sample covers every shape the run saw.
 *   • Attract reaches the renderer hand-off, the not-armed return, the Mario-dead skip, and claims
 *     at slots 0..7 ONLY; slots 8 and 9, the nothing-free scan and the already-claimed skip are
 *     crafted on real captures.
 *
 * OBSERVED FAILING AGAINST THIS FILE, not only against the twins — recorded because a gate nobody
 * has watched fail is not known to work:
 *   • dropping the bit-1 (already claimed) test fails the crafted occupied-record arm
 *     (`skip an occupied record (bit 1 only): RAM@0x62aa oracle=32 cand=0`). The captured replay
 *     does NOT catch that one: attract never parked an occupied record in front of a free one.
 *   • handing the claim `remaining + 1` fails the captured replay (`captured dispatch
 *     [board=1 alive=1 gate=0 armed=1 claim@0]: RAM@0x62ac oracle=128 cand=124`).
 *
 * THE LIVE-OUT DERIVATION, cross-file and therefore here rather than in the routine: ROM 0x197A is
 * the only call site of 0x2C8F anywhere in the tree, and it discards the return value; its next
 * act is scheduleBarrelRelease, which loads the accumulator before its first read, so no register
 * or flag this routine leaves is read back. The record base and the countdown handed to
 * releaseBarrelIntoFreeSlot are internal to that direct call and land in RAM anyway (the record
 * base in RENDER_OBJ_PTR, the count-derived sprite slot in RENDER_DST_PTR), which is where this
 * gate pins them. The live-out is DERIVED; there is no live-wire arm in this file.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-2c8f.test.js
