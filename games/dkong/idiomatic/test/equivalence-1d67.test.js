 * Equivalence test for endClimbAtLadderLimit (ROM 0x1d67) — the climb stepper's
 * ladder-end dismount arm.
 *
 * The routine WRITES MEMORY (0x6207 := 6, 0x6219 := 0, 0x6215 := 0, then the four
 * sprite-record bytes 0x694C..0x694F via its 0x1DA6 tail) and its oracle ends in a
 * `ret` (the 0x1DA6 tail's), so it is gated on MEMORY-equivalence — RAM (minus
 * STACK_SCRATCH) + pc + SP — never on a register file (its live-out is memory-only;
 * see the routine header), and every case runs on a FRESH clone (a reused clone is
 * only safe for a read-only leaf; this writes). The idiomatic routine models the Z80
 * `ret` as a JS return and touches no pc/SP, so the harness performs ONE m.ret() on
 * the candidate clone after the call to line pc + SP up with the oracle (the oracle
 * reaches its `ret` at 0x1DBC through the unconditional `jp 0x1da6` tail; that pop
 * reads bytes in STACK_SCRATCH, excluded by the contract).
 *
 * The oracle itself dispatches its 0x1DA6 tail through m.call, which resolves via the
 * clone's routine registry to the TRANSLATED entry_1da6 (the frozen oracle for that
 * address); the idiomatic routine calls the proven-equivalent writeMarioSpriteRecord
 * directly. loc_1d67 is a single straight-line arm (no branches), so one real
 * dispatch is its full control-flow coverage; crafted entries then exercise the data.
 *
 *   1. EQUAL (real dispatches) — hook 0x1d67 in a real attract run. The 25m demo
 *      climbs a ladder to its top, so loc_1d11 tail-jumps here for real (once per
 *      attract loop). oracle vs candidate must agree on RAM + pc + SP.
 *
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted source + pre-set targets) — from a real captured state, poke the
 *      four sprite source fields (X/code/attr/Y) to distinct sentinels AND pre-set the
 *      three stored bytes (0x6207/0x6219/0x6215) to non-target values, so the crafted
 *      cases pin (a) the exact source->record-slot copy and (b) that the three stores
 *      force 6/0/0 regardless of prior contents. Each compared identically both sides.
 *
 *   3. TEETH — two deliberately-broken twins, each MUST be caught:
 *      (a) keep-on-ladder — omits the MARIO_ON_LADDER (0x6215) := 0 store, leaving it
 *          at its entry value; diverges whenever 0x6215 != 0 at entry (it is 1 — on a
 *          ladder — on every real dispatch).
 *      (b) wrong-sprite-code — writes 0x04 (a climb pose) into 0x6207 instead of 0x06,
 *          which also propagates to record slot +1; diverges on every entry.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-1d67.test.js
