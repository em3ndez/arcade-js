/**
 * Equivalence test for loc_2101 (ROM 0x2101) — call the object retirement gate at ROM 0x24B4 and
 * fall through into the left-edge check at ROM 0x2104 only when that gate returns. Both
 * destinations are the frozen oracle on BOTH sides here and are therefore NOT under test. What
 * this gate has to prove is the protocol: the return-address bracket is placed, the gate is
 * called, and the fall-through runs if and only if the gate answered that control came back.
 *
 *   0. REACHABILITY — how many real dispatches a 1200-frame attract run produces, how many
 *      distinct entry shapes they cover, and — measured with the GATE'S OWN ORACLE, not with the
 *      rewrite — which branch each one takes. Every one takes the same branch, which is why arm 2
 *      exists.
 *
 *   1. EQUAL (captured) — replayed INLINE AT THE DISPATCH: at each one the host clones twice, runs
 *      the oracle on one clone and the rewrite on the other, compares, and discards. Every
 *      dispatch is replayed; nothing is sampled. The comparison is the FULL state dump, split so
 *      it reports whether the byte that differs is a live cell or one in the dead stack scratch,
 *      plus SP, the program counter and the RETURN VALUE. pc and SP are compared because this
 *      rewrite keeps every stack operation the oracle performs and therefore legitimately holds
 *      them — and SP is the ONLY check that sees a dropped bracket (twin c below).
 *
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted: the retirement arm attract never takes) — the branch this routine exists
 *      for is never taken during attract, so it is reached by poking a REAL captured entry: the
 *      record's vertical position to the gate's firing threshold and its horizontal position to
 *      three places inside the gate's firing band, on every capture. The arm is asserted to have
 *      actually flipped by running the gate's own frozen oracle, so the craft cannot silently
 *      degenerate into more of arm 1.
 *
 *   3. PROTOCOL (stubbed destinations) — both destinations are replaced, on each fresh clone, by
 *      stubs that record their invocation and let the harness DICTATE the gate's answer. The
 *      expected call sequence is taken from the ORACLE run through the same stubs, so it is not
 *      circular. This pins "call the gate first, then the fall-through if and only if the answer
 *      was true", and the value pushed as the return address, against a verdict this file chooses
 *      rather than one attract happens to produce. The stubs are installed per clone — a stub set
 *      on a parent machine does NOT survive clone(), which rebuilds its routine table — and their
 *      liveness is asserted rather than assumed.
 *
 *   4. LIVE-WIRE — the rewrite drives a whole 1400-frame attract run as a registered override and
 *      every frame of the state trace must match the all-oracle baseline on the FULL dump,
 *      including the stack scratch (this rewrite has no stack traffic of its own to lose). Both
 *      sides run under the CYCLE-FREE engine at the manifest's vblank poll PC, which is what makes
 *      the 17 T-states the rewrite does not charge for the dropped call instruction a non-issue:
 *      the NMI is timed by control flow there, not by the clock, so there is no deficit to repay
 *      and no PRNG to reseed. The dispatch count is asserted non-zero and pinned, because a live
 *      arm that never executes the routine passes green while proving nothing.
 *
 *   5. LIVE-WIRE CONTROL — the same run wired with a broken twin MUST fork, so arm 4 is shown to
 *      be sensitive rather than lenient; and the twin that only arm 2 can see is confirmed to slip
 *      through arm 4 untouched, which is the measured reason arm 2 is not optional.
 *
 *   6. TEETH — four broken twins. The three replay arms catch DISJOINT sets, which is the point:
 *        (a) no guard        — continues inline after the gate retired the object. INVISIBLE to
 *                              arms 1 and 4 (attract never takes that branch); caught only by
 *                              arm 2, mostly as a FAULT rather than a diff, so the harness treats
 *                              a thrown error as a result.
 *        (b) wrong tail      — falls into ROM 0x2118 instead of ROM 0x2104. Caught by arm 1;
 *                              invisible to arm 2, where the tail is never reached at all.
 *        (c) no bracket      — drops the pushed return address. Leaves every LIVE cell identical;
 *                              caught only by the SP comparison.
 *        (d) swallowed result— correct control flow, answers false instead of handing back the
 *                              tail's result. Invisible to RAM, SP and pc; caught only by the
 *                              return assertion. Not hypothetical: a false answer from an address
 *                              that is not in machine.js's SEAM_CALLER_SKIP makes the seam consume
 *                              a stack word the routine does not owe.
 *
 * COVERAGE THIS DOES NOT CLAIM: attract only, plus pokes and stubs on top of attract state. No
 * credited game and no board past 25m. The gate's third early-return arm is never exercised —
 * that is ROM 0x24B4's business, not this routine's, whose only branch is covered on both sides.
 *
 * Isolated replays use clone(), whose frame machinery is neutralised (nextNmi / nextBoundary =
 * Infinity), so an m.step inside the oracle cannot trip a live NMI whose handler would write RAM
 * and masquerade as an oracle side effect. A clone DOES inherit the capturing override, and this
 * routine's tail chain re-enters the object loop that dispatches it — so a replay would re-enter
 * the capture and recurse. The `busy` latch below is what stops that; while it is set the hook is
 * a pass-through to the oracle, so nested dispatches inside a replay run pure oracle on both sides.
