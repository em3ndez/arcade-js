/**
 * Equivalence test for loc_33a1 (ROM 0x33A1) — the board gate + height test that guards
 * driveFireLadderClimb's movement path, and returns the caller-skip boolean.
 *
 * The routine reads exactly two bytes (BOARD, through boardBitGate, and the object record's
 * +0x0f Y base) and writes none, so its whole product is the boolean. The gate is therefore
 * built around that boolean — but the RAM half of the contract is asserted too (both sides must
 * leave work RAM untouched) and twin (e) below proves it bites.
 *
 * NOT RECURSIVE. 0x33A1 is twelve ROM bytes whose only transfer out is the one-byte board gate
 * at 0x0030, and a scan of the whole 16K ROM finds exactly ONE reference to 0x33A1 — the call at
 * 0x334A inside driveFireLadderClimb. There is no self-recursive arm, so none is covered here; the test that
 * would exercise it does not exist because the code path does not.
 *
 * WHAT IS COMPARED. RAM − STACK_SCRATCH plus the boolean. pc/SP are NOT compared: they are the
 * Z80 stack idiom the boolean replaces (the oracle's board-gate skip, its splice and its plain
 * return all move pc/SP; the idiomatic routine touches neither). Instead of dropping that
 * meaning, test 2 pins it directly — it asserts WHERE THE ORACLE'S OWN RETURN LANDS on each arm,
 * against distinct sentinel return addresses, which is what makes "true = driveFireLadderClimb was returned
 * to normally" a measured claim rather than a reading of the disassembly.
 *
 *   0. REACHABILITY — 0x33A1 is dispatched naturally: 114 times in an 8000-frame attract run.
 *      The test measures the count AND classifies each captured entry by arm behaviourally (it
 *      re-runs the oracle with the Y base poked to both extremes and sees whether the answer
 *      moves). Every natural dispatch lands on ONE arm — gate open, Y base at or below the line
 *      — so the captured case alone proves only that arm; the number is printed, not rounded up
 *      into a claim of coverage.
 *   1. EQUAL (captured) — every captured dispatch replayed oracle-vs-candidate on fresh clones.
 *   2. ORACLE STACK SEMANTICS — the boolean's meaning, measured on all three arms.
 *   3. EQUAL (crafted) — the two arms attract never reaches: the 100m gate-closed arm (with the
 *      Y base at both extremes, proving the gate short-circuits the height test) and the
 *      above-the-line splice, plus the 88/89/90 boundary and the 0/255 ends.
 *   4. EQUAL (exhaustive) — all 65,536 (BOARD, +0x0f) pairs. The routine's behaviour is a total
 *      function of those two bytes, so this is complete coverage of its input space. The BOOLEAN
 *      is compared on every pair; the full 5KB RAM dump is compared on every board at eight Y
 *      bases (the ends, the boundary and its neighbours — 2,048 pairs) and once more after the
 *      last iteration, where a stray write from ANY of the 65,536 would still be sitting, since
 *      the two machines are never reset between them.
 *   5. IX-RELATIVE — the tested byte follows the record pointer, not a fixed address.
 *   6. TEETH — five broken twins, each of which the gate MUST catch:
 *      (a) the board gate conflated with the caller-skip (returns false when the gate closes),
 *      (b) the height test inverted, (c) the boundary off by one (only 89 exactly separates
 *      them), (d) the wrong record offset (+0x0e — the offset-namespace trap), and
 *      (e) a twin that WRITES the compared byte into the record, which only the RAM half of the
 *      contract can catch.
 *
