/**
 * Equivalence gate for loc_2053 (ROM 0x2053) — the arc-travel branch of the OBJ_ARRAY_67
 * object sweep.
 *
 * The routine is four decisions: swap to the shadow register set, step the record along its
 * ballistic arc, probe the girder under it, and then route to one of four still-frozen
 * continuations — the sub-state machine (ROM 0x2083), the retire arm (ROM 0x2079), or the
 * bounds gate (ROM 0x24B4) followed by an orientation refresh and the shared sprite tail
 * (ROM 0x21BA). Almost all of the visible work happens in those continuations, so this gate is
 * mostly a gate on WHICH ONE runs and on what it is handed.
 *
 * CONTRACT COMPARED HERE: work/sprite/video RAM minus STACK_SCRATCH plus the return value — the
 * required memory-equivalence contract — and, as EXTRAS that happen to hold, pc, SP and the full
 * MAIN register file. The extras hold for a derivable reason: the frozen continuations run the
 * whole rest of the sweep and return through the same `ret`, and the sweep's shared tail swaps
 * the register sets back, so by the time control returns the main set belongs to the sweep and
 * not to this branch. Measured: over the 1246 captured dispatches the only registers that ever
 * differ are the SHADOW set (B', C', D', E', H', L') — exactly the state this rewrite drops when
 * it hands over. pc and SP are not decoration here: they are the ONLY surface that catches the
 * dropped-call-bracket twin, which leaves RAM and the return value untouched.
 *
 * THE RETURN VALUE IS UNDEFINED ON EVERY ARM, of the oracle and of the rewrite alike, so
 * asserting it is near-vacuous. The observable that replaces it is WHICH ARM control left
 * through, and it is derived NON-CIRCULARLY: the label comes from hooks on the continuation
 * addresses that record the ORACLE's own outgoing calls at the outermost dispatch, and the same
 * labeller is then run over the rewrite and the two labels compared.
 *
 * WHY THE ENTRIES ARE REHOSTED. A capture is cloned from a machine carrying the capturing
 * override, and clone() reruns the constructor, so a clone carries it too. This branch's tail
 * chain RE-ENTERS 0x2053 for the sweep's remaining slots, so replaying on a plain clone would
 * re-trigger the capture hook and clone again, over and over. Every entry is therefore rehosted
 * into a FRESH override-free Machine, which also means nested re-entries run the oracle on both
 * sides and the comparison isolates the ONE outermost dispatch. That same property is what makes
 * the captured replay strong: it carries the WHOLE REMAINDER of the sweep on both sides, so a
 * later branch reading a register this rewrite dropped would surface as a RAM difference.
 *
 * WHAT EACH TEST ACTUALLY COVERS — read this before trusting a green run:
 *
 *   1. CAPTURED (real dispatches). 3000 attract frames dispatch 0x2053 1246 times and ALL 1246
 *      are replayed — no sampling, so there is no sampling policy to be wrong about. That is not
 *      tidiness here: two of the six arms attract reaches occur ONCE each in those 1246, so any
 *      fixed stride would have missed them. Attract is 25m only and fills record slots 0-6, so
 *      the captures say nothing about slots 7-9, the other boards, or gameplay.
 *
 *   2. ARM AGREEMENT. For every one of those captures, the arm the oracle leaves through equals
 *      the arm the rewrite leaves through. This is the void-return routine's real observable.
 *
 *   3. CRAFTED (the retire arm, from both sides of its window). Attract reaches the retire arm
 *      exactly once in 1246 dispatches, and on the wrapping side of the window only — so its low
 *      half is reached by nothing else here. Two entries are crafted by poking ONE byte — the
 *      record's X — on a real captured machine, stack and caller frames included: one inside the
 *      window's low half and one inside its wrapping half. Each asserts which arm the poke
 *      actually reached, so a poke that changed nothing would fail as vacuous rather than pass
 *      as coverage.
 *
 *   4. LIVE (whole-machine). The rewrite is wired at 0x2053 for a 3000-frame attract run and
 *      every frame's state dump is compared against the all-oracle baseline, minus
 *      STACK_SCRATCH. THE OVERRIDE RESTORES THE ORACLE'S MEASURED CYCLE COST, measured per
 *      dispatch by running the oracle on a throwaway rehost and charging the difference the
 *      candidate has not already spent itself in the frozen continuations. The dispatch count is
 *      asserted equal to the captured count, so the case cannot pass while the routine never
 *      runs. Attract only; gameplay is NOT covered by any test here.
 *
 *   5. LIVE-OUT. A twin identical to the rewrite except that it scrambles the shadow register
 *      set immediately before EVERY hand-off — the exact state this rewrite drops, at the exact
 *      points it drops it — is wired live for the same 3000-frame run. The trace stays
 *      byte-identical, so nothing downstream reads those registers back.
 *
 *   6. TEETH — seven deliberately-broken twins the cases above MUST catch:
 *        (a) the register-set swap dropped;
 *        (b) the girder probe run but its answer ignored;
 *        (c) the retire window tested without its wrap, so only the low side fires;
 *        (d) the retire test read off the record's Y instead of its X;
 *        (e) the orientation selector scaled to 0/2 instead of 0/4;
 *        (f) the bounds gate's return-address bracket dropped;
 *        (g) the bounds gate's splice ignored, so the branch keeps going after control left.
 *      (f) is the one that only pc and SP can see; (g) is caught by a single capture out of
 *      1246, which is the case for replaying every dispatch rather than a sample.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-2053.test.js
