 * Equivalence test for buildHowHighScreen (ROM 0x0BDA) — the credited-game (GAME_STATE 3)
 * sub-state 8 handler that builds the "HOW HIGH CAN YOU GET?" interlude screen and steps
 * the sub-state forward. It is reached via dispatchInGameSubstate off the 0x0702 table[8],
 * only once a game is credited and started — attract never reaches it.
 *
 * It is not a leaf: it silences sound, gates on the frame timer, clears the screen, posts
 * two ring tasks, seeds palette/sound/climb-figure state, steps the height index, and paints
 * a variable number of girder rows. So it is validated by MEMORY-equivalence against the
 * frozen oracle — RAM − STACK_SCRATCH — never the full register file, never cycles, with a
 * FRESH clone per case (it writes memory and carries state across rows):
 *
 *   1. REALISM (captured driven dispatch) — drive a coin+start into a credited game so
 *      GAME_STATE reaches 3 and sub-state 8 dispatches, and clone the machine at the real
 *      entry. Run the ORACLE on one clone and buildHowHighScreen on another and prove
 *      RAM(−stack) identical. The four callees (silenceSound, tickSubstateTimer,
 *      clearPlayfieldAndSprites, enqueueTask) run their real idiomatic implementations on
 *      the candidate side and the frozen oracle on the oracle side, so a divergence anywhere
 *      in the routine or its marshalling surfaces as divergent memory. The natural dispatch
 *      is the gate-expired / clamp-keep / step-take / 1-row arm.
 *
 *   2. CRAFTED (branch coverage) — the arms the driven run never reaches, each poked
 *      IDENTICALLY on both sides on a real captured entry: the rst-0x18 gate-SKIP early
 *      return, the clamp-set-5 arm, the height step-skip arm, several row counts, and the
 *      256-row do-while wrap (row count 0). Each is proven EQUAL on RAM(−stack), and the gate
 *      arm additionally asserts SUBSTATE_TIMER shows the branch actually taken (0x04 skipped
 *      vs 0xA0 body-ran) so the coverage is not vacuous.
 *
 *   3. TEETH — a twin whose first store to HOW_HIGH_LAST_SEQ (0x622F) lands the wrong value
 *      MUST be caught: buildHowHighScreen writes 0x622F once and nothing rewrites it, so the
 *      corruption persists as the sole RAM(−stack) divergence.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-0bda.test.js
