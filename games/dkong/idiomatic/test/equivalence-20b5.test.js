/**
 * Equivalence gate for loc_20b5 (ROM 0x20B5) — the arm that stamps a −1.0 px/frame horizontal step
 * onto an object record whose whole-pixel step byte is zero, and routes every other record to the
 * mirror arm at ROM 0x20E1. Both exits continue into the still-frozen tail at ROM 0x20C3.
 *
 * WHAT IS COMPARED — the memory-equivalence contract for the DISSOLVED form. loc_20b5 no longer
 * reaches its continuations through m.call: it DIRECT-CALLS the idiomatic loc_20e1 (mirror arm) and
 * loc_20c3 (fall-through), each of which direct-calls on down to the still-frozen m.call(0x1f83).
 * Both sides run the rest of the object loop to completion; measured, they leave RAM outside the
 * stack window and the final SP identical, and only the frozen side's call/ret bracket writes into
 * the stack window. So this gate asserts:
 *   - RAM EXCLUDING the STACK_SCRATCH window {0x6be0,0x6c00}: the frozen chain's bracket writes a
 *     return address there at an SP the JS chain does not push to, so the two runs legitimately
 *     differ inside it and nowhere else;
 *   - this routine's OWN ordered store sequence — its writes to the record's two step bytes,
 *     isolated by address so the tail chain's writes are not mixed in. This is the only half that
 *     sees a value-neutral store: the local arm writes the fraction FIRST and the whole byte SECOND,
 *     and swapping them leaves identical RAM. Carried as a teeth case;
 *   - the final guest SP (a stray push in the dissolved form lands in the excluded window yet still
 *     moves SP, so this stays load-bearing);
 *   - the propagated return value, `undefined` on every entry reached here — so it carries little on
 *     its own, and the TAIL CHOICE test manufactures the arm observable the weak return leaves
 *     missing.
 * pc and the rest of the register file are dropped with the frozen call bracket that used to justify
 * them; cycles are NOT compared (the rewrite is cycle-free), and the LIVE run restores the dissolved
 * fragment's true oracle cost per dispatch instead.
 *
 *   0/1. REACHABILITY + EQUAL (captured) — 0x20B5 is dispatched naturally during attract, and every
 *        dispatch is replayed INLINE at the dispatch: two clones, oracle on one, candidate on the
 *        other, compare, discard. That is O(1) memory and covers EVERY dispatch, so there is no
 *        sampling policy to be wrong about. The tests assert the dispatch count, that BOTH arms
 *        occur, and that attract delivers only the two whole-pixel bytes 0 and 255 — the honest
 *        hole the crafted sweep in test 5 exists to fill, asserted so it cannot quietly become
 *        coverage.
 *   3. LIVE — the live-out measurement: the rewrite wired at 0x20B5 for a whole 4000-frame attract
 *      run, its per-frame trace diffed against the all-oracle baseline on every cell outside
 *      STACK_SCRATCH, with the dispatch count asserted non-zero and equal to the oracle run's. The
 *      dissolved fragment's cycle-free cost is measured PER DISPATCH (priceDissolved, to the frozen
 *      walk-step boundary) and charged back. COVERAGE: attract only. Gameplay, the other boards and
 *      every crafted shape are not run live.
 *   4. LIVE TEETH — dropping the cycle charge MUST move the trace, so test 3 is sensitive rather
 *      than lenient.
 *   5. EQUAL (crafted) — all 256 whole-pixel step bytes crossed with four fractions (1024 entries),
 *      each a real captured state with two surgical pokes applied identically to both sides, plus
 *      all ten OBJ_ARRAY_67 record bases. This is the only thing that reaches the whole-pixel bytes
 *      1..254 at all.
 *   6. TAIL CHOICE — the manufactured observable. The routine is run to completion on a real
 *      captured machine and the record it hands on is read back: the local arm leaves the leftward
 *      step (whole 255) stamped, the mirror arm leaves loc_20e1's rightward step (whole 1), so which
 *      arm ran is directly visible in the record. (The old form stubbed the two continuations with
 *      m.routines.set; a direct call cannot be intercepted that way, so the stub is replaced by
 *      reading the record.)
 *   7. TEETH — seven broken twins, each of which this contract must catch, followed by two tests
 *      that pin WHICH half catches what: a swapped store ORDER, which the state, the SP and the
 *      return are all blind to and only the own-store sequence sees; and a twin that misreads a
 *      whole-pixel byte attract never delivers, which every one of the 23 real dispatches misses
 *      and only the crafted sweep catches — so neither half of the gate is decorative.
 *
 * ON RE-ENTRY. The tail runs the rest of the object walk, which can dispatch 0x20B5 again for a
 * later slot, and a clone carries the source machine's override map. The hook therefore has two
 * disarms: it delegates straight to the oracle while a replay is in progress, and again once the
 * host run is over. So every comparison runs ONE dispatch of the candidate with the oracle
 * underneath it on both sides, and no replay can recurse into another replay.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-20b5.test.js
