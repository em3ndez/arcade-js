/**
 * Equivalence test for loc_0413 (ROM 0x0413) — the per-frame entry to the state-0 colour
 * cycle: advance a running sweep, re-arm a fresh one at the frame-counter wrap, else repaint.
 *
 * loc_0413 gates on two RAM bytes and routes three ways:
 *
 *   - COLOUR_CYCLE_ACTIVE (0x6391) != 0        -> advanceColorCycleSweep (ROM 0x0426).
 *   - active == 0, FRAME (0x601A) != 0         -> dispatchColorCyclePaint (ROM 0x0486): repaint.
 *   - active == 0, FRAME == 0 (the wrap)       -> set COLOUR_CYCLE_ACTIVE = 1, then
 *                                                 advanceColorCycleSweep (arm + advance).
 *
 * Its callers (entry_03fb / entry_0400) tail-jump into it, and both callees tail-jump onward,
 * so down EVERY path the oracle nets exactly ONE caller-return pop and only READS the stack
 * (the pushed bytes land in STACK_SCRATCH, excluded by the memory-equivalence contract). The
 * idiomatic routine models the Z80 stack as the JS call stack (direct calls, no push16/ret of
 * its own), so the harness performs ONE m.ret() on the candidate to line pc + SP up with the
 * oracle. A `new Machine(ROM)` with no overrides runs the pure translated subtree for every
 * m.call, so the oracle side is the frozen translated cascade; the candidate side is the
 * idiomatic cascade via direct imports. Every case runs on a FRESH clone (the callees write
 * memory).
 *
 *   1. REALISM (captured) — hook 0x0413 in a real attract run and confirm loc_0413 == oracle
 *      over every natural dispatch, classified by the route the entry forces. All three routes
 *      (active, repaint, start-of-sweep) occur naturally in a 25m attract.
 *
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted) — force the active arm (active==1 and active==0x40 to prove "nonzero"
 *      not "==1"), the repaint arm (FRAME==5 and FRAME==0x80 to prove "nonzero" not "==1", plus
 *      the rivet board), and the start-of-sweep arm (a mid-sweep re-arm, a re-arm that
 *      immediately tops the sweep out, and a re-arm that lands on a 32-frame boundary reload),
 *      each over the whole contract (RAM - STACK_SCRATCH + pc + SP) plus a route-discriminating
 *      non-vacuity check.
 *
 *   3. TEETH — four deliberately-broken twins, each reusing the real idiomatic callees so the
 *      only divergence is the injected bug, each MUST be caught:
 *      (a) dropped re-arm write     — the wrap arm forgets COLOUR_CYCLE_ACTIVE=1; caught at 0x6391.
 *      (b) repaint arm advances     — repaint route steps the sweep counter; caught at 0x6390.
 *      (c) inverted active gate      — active route repaints instead of advancing; caught at 0x6390.
 *      (d) active gate tests ==1     — an active==0x40 entry repaints instead of advancing; caught at 0x6390.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-0413.test.js
