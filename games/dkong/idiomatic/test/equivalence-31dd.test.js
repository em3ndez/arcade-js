 * Equivalence test for armAlternateFireModeAtHighDifficulty (ROM 0x31DD) — the difficulty+entropy gated object arm.
 *
 * sub_31dd stamps 2 into field +0x19 of records 1 and 3 of the 0x6400 object array
 * (0x6439 / 0x6479) only when TWO gates open: (1) difficulty (0x6380) passes a SIGNED
 * test on (difficulty - 3) — it proceeds while that stays non-negative as a signed byte,
 * so for difficulty in [3, 130] — and (2) the timing-entropy helper (loc_31f6, reading
 * RANDOM 0x6018 / FRAME 0x601A) returns exactly 1. Either gate closed → no write.
 *
 * The oracle calls the entropy helper with the translated `push16 0x31e6 / call 0x31f6`
 * bracket; the idiomatic routine dissolves that to a direct loc_31f6(m). So on any pass
 * that reaches the call, the oracle leaves the pushed return address (0x31e6) as dead
 * bytes in STACK_SCRATCH that the candidate never writes — hence the memory-equivalence
 * contract here is RAM − STACK_SCRATCH + pc + SP, and runCandidate performs ONE m.ret()
 * after the routine so pc + SP line up with the oracle's net single caller-return pop
 * (every oracle path nets exactly that). Live-out is memory-only; sub_31dd returns
 * nothing a caller consumes.
 *
 * The write is a pure function of just THREE bytes (difficulty, random, frame), so the
 * gates factor cleanly and an effectively-exhaustive proof is available:
 *
 *   1. EQUAL (difficulty gate, exhaustive) — sweep all 256 difficulty values with the
 *      entropy draw pinned OPEN (random=1, frame=1 → draw 1) and pinned CLOSED
 *      (random=0, frame=0 → draw 0). With the draw open the write happens iff the signed
 *      gate passes, so this exhaustively pins the [3,130] boundary INCLUDING the signed
 *      wrap at 0x83 and the {0,1,2} low end; with the draw closed nothing writes at any
 *      difficulty.
 *
 *   2. EQUAL (entropy gate, exhaustive) — at a passing difficulty (3), sweep the WHOLE
 *      256×256 (random, frame) space, so the write happens iff the draw is 1. This pins
 *      the ==1 comparison, the frame-substitution arm, and that no high bits of random
 *      matter. Together with (1) all four (gate-pass × draw) quadrants are covered.
 *
 *   3. TEETH — three deliberately-broken twins the same sweeps MUST catch:
 *        (a) unsigned (carry) difficulty gate — `difficulty < 3` instead of the signed
 *            sign-bit test; diverges at difficulty >= 0x83 (signed skips, carry writes).
 *        (b) dropped second write — writes 0x6439 but not 0x6479.
 *        (c) inverted entropy gate — writes when the draw is NOT 1.
 *
 *   4. REALISM — the caller DOES dispatch 0x31DD every attract pass, but difficulty stays 1
 *      in attract, so every real dispatch takes the gate-1 (difficulty) skip; those no-write
 *      captures must still match the oracle, and they do. The write/entropy arms are never
 *      reached live, so the sweeps carry them. The sweeps also run atop a real boot+attract
 *      base, so realistic surrounding RAM would expose any hidden dependence.
 *
