/**
 * Equivalence test for clearSubstateWhenTimerExpires (ROM 0x084b) — the timed
 * sub-state gate that clears GAME_SUBSTATE once the two-level countdown expires.
 *
 * loc_084b reads NO memory of its own: its entire observable behaviour is a function
 * of just TWO bytes, SUBSTATE_TIMER_LO (0x6008) and SUBSTATE_TIMER (0x6009), ticked
 * through the rst-0x20 skip helper, plus one conditional write to GAME_SUBSTATE
 * (0x600A). (Probed: on synthetic entries the oracle writes only {0x6008, 0x6009,
 * 0x600A} outside the stack.) It is a VOID handler — nothing downstream consumes a
 * return; the `rst 0x20` skip only unwinds the return address the rst itself pushed,
 * so control lands back in the dispatcher on both branches. Everything else the oracle
 * touches (SP, the pushed 0x084c return byte, HL/A/F) is the Z80 caller-skip mechanism
 * the direct-call model replaces — the pushed byte lands in STACK_SCRATCH (real SP at
 * dispatch is 0x6bee/0x6bf0, deep in that dead region), so it is excluded from the
 * contract, which is therefore RAM (minus STACK_SCRATCH). That leaves the strongest
 * gate available:
 *
 *   1. EQUAL (exhaustive) — clearSubstateWhenTimerExpires == oracle over ALL 65,536
 *      (lo,hi) combos of (0x6008, 0x6009), compared on RAM (minus STACK_SCRATCH).
 *      GAME_SUBSTATE is seeded to a nonzero sentinel so the clear-to-0 is observable
 *      (loc_084b never reads it, so the branch logic is unaffected). 256×256 is the
 *      complete input space — a proof, not a sample.
 *
 *   2. TEETH (exhaustive) — two deliberately-broken twins the sweep MUST catch, both
 *      on the memory half of the contract:
 *        (a) clear-on-any-underflow — clears 0x600A whenever the LOW prescaler
 *            underflows, ignoring whether the high half also expired. It ticks the
 *            same 0x6008/0x6009 as the oracle, so only the 0x600A byte diverges, and
 *            only on the lo==1, hi!=1 edge. Proves the sweep reaches that edge and the
 *            RAM diff sees the wrong clear.
 *        (b) never-clears — runs the countdown but never writes 0x600A. Caught on the
 *            full-expire case (lo==1, hi==1), where the oracle clears and it does not.
 *
 *   3. REALISM (captured dispatches) — hook 0x084b in a real attract run, clone the
 *      machine at each true dispatch (fired from game-state-1 sub-state 7), and confirm
 *      the candidate reproduces the oracle's RAM on every real state the game produces.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-084b.test.js
