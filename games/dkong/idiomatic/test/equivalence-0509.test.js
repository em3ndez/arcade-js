/**
 * Equivalence test for blinkSpritePairByX (ROM 0x0509) — the bit-6-clear arm of the
 * rivet-board colour-cycle blink block: read the player X (MARIO_X, 0x6203) and route the
 * decorative-sprite-pair blink to loc_04f9 "blink OFF" when X >= 0x80 (right half) or
 * loc_04e1 "blink ON" when X < 0x80 (left half).
 *
 * loc_0509 is a pure two-way DISPATCHER. Its only own effect is the branch on 0x6203; the
 * memory it leaves is entirely the taken arm's {0x6901, 0x6905} (both arms write both
 * bytes) — bit 7 forced clear on the OFF arm, set on the ON arm — so the two arms ALWAYS
 * differ in bit 7 of the result and the branch is observable on every input. It is
 * validated memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle (RAM minus STACK_SCRATCH; never the
 * full register file, never cycles):
 *
 *   loc_0509 is NOT reached in attract (0 dispatches / 6000 frames: it needs the 100m
 *   rivet board, BOARD 0x6227 == 4, which attract never reaches). So — exactly as its two
 *   callees are gated — realistic bases are captured at the store tail 0x04ac (reached
 *   ~1500x/attract) and loc_0509 entries are CRAFTED on them:
 *
 *   1. CRAFTED + FOOTPRINT (real attract bases) — over a matrix of MARIO_X (below, AT, and
 *      above the 0x80 boundary), the two blink bytes, and the sweep counter C (non-toggle
 *      + toggle phase), on each real base: (a) the oracle's write footprint ⊆ {0x6901,
 *      0x6905}; (b) ARMS EXERCISED — X >= 0x80 clears bit 7 on both bytes, X < 0x80 sets it
 *      (both arms reached); (c) REALISM — a fresh-clone whole-machine RAM diff (minus dead
 *      stack) between the oracle and blinkSpritePairByX is empty.
 *
 *   2. TEETH — a boundary-flipped twin (`>` instead of `>=`) mis-routes ONLY at X == 0x80
 *      (OFF vs ON) and so agrees everywhere else; the same crafted matrix (which includes
 *      X == 0x80) MUST catch it. Proves the boundary is genuinely exercised.
 *
 * The oracle side runs the pure frozen chain: on a bare-registry clone, the oracle
 * loc_0509's `m.call(0x04f9|0x04e1)` resolves to the translated callees and their tail
 * `m.call(0x04ac)` to translated loc_04ac (the capture hook delegates to it once caps are
 * full). The candidate calls the already-idiomatic callees directly — both proven
 * memory-equivalent, so any RAM diff is loc_0509's own branch logic.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-0509.test.js
