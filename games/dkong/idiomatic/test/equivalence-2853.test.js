 * Equivalence test for loc_2853 (ROM 0x2853) — set up the object-overlap search inputs
 * (object base, a Y-derived bound, and a direction-selected threshold word) and tail-
 * dispatch to the current board's overlap-search arm, returning the severity code the
 * caller consumes.
 *
 * Attract dispatches 0x2853 only sparsely, so captured states under-cover the input space. The
 * behaviour factors into three set-ups — object base (IY=0x6200), search bound (C=MARIO_Y+12),
 * threshold word (HL, directed by the input's two direction bits) — consumed by the search arm;
 * on 25m that arm counts overlaps into OVERLAP_COUNT (0x6060) and returns a 0/1/3/7 severity.
 *
 * The dissolved routine returns the severity by JS value and opens no guest-stack bracket, so it is
 * validated by RAM − STACK_SCRATCH plus that returned severity vs the oracle's A. pc/SP are seam
 * artifacts (oracle `call 0x3e88` / terminal `ret`) and are not compared.
 *
 *   1. REALISM (captured) — hook 0x2853 in attract, clone at each true dispatch, confirm == oracle
 *      (RAM − STACK_SCRATCH, returned severity) across the count-0 and count>0 arms.
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted) — sweep player Y over both direction arms through the live 25m counter, and
 *      route through the other boards' arms (2/3/4), matching the oracle.
 *   3. EQUAL (boundary) — three single-object entries at the overlap boundary, each depending on
 *      exactly one set-up; confirms == oracle AND that the oracle counts the expected object.
 *
 *   4. TEETH — three broken twins, each MUST be caught at OVERLAP_COUNT:
 *      (a) wrong Y offset (MARIO_Y + 13) — shifts the search bound, flips the boundary object.
 *      (b) inverted threshold select — picks the wrong threshold word for the input.
 *      (c) wrong object base (IY = 0x6300) — the cross-axis reference reads the wrong cell.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-2853.test.js
