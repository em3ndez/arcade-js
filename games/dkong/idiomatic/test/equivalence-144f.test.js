/**
 * Equivalence test for selectPlayer2AndComposeScreen (ROM 0x144F) — the record==3
 * arm of loc_141E that makes player 2 the current player, then delegates to the shared
 * compose tail loc_1459 with the player key A = 0.
 *
 * loc_144F WRITES memory — CURRENT_PLAYER (0x600D) and its companion 0x600E to 1, plus
 * (via the loc_1459 subtree) SUBSTATE_TIMER (0x6009), GAME_SUBSTATE (0x600A), and the task
 * ring + TASK_TAIL — and the flip-screen board latch (0x7D82). It has NO register live-in
 * that reaches its output (loc_141E enters it with A = 3, the search key, which loc_144F
 * overwrites). So it is validated by capture/clone/replay on a FRESH clone per case — never
 * reusing one machine, never the full register file, never cycles. The compared contract is:
 *
 *   RAM (minus STACK_SCRATCH)  +  io.flipScreen (the 0x7D82 latch)
 *
 * The flip latch is a board io output, NOT in the RAM dump; comparing io.flipScreen is
 * load-bearing because it is the only place the player-key A value (0 here, forced) surfaces
 * when the cabinet DIP is off. SP/pc are NOT compared — the idiomatic layer drops the
 * oracle's per-post push/ret bookkeeping (its residue lands only in STACK_SCRATCH); the
 * candidate is instead asserted to leave SP/pc untouched, proving it models no stack.
 *
 * REACHABILITY. loc_144F is NOT reached in attract or a 1-player coin+start run: its parent
 * loc_141E (GAME_STATE 3, GAME_SUBSTATE 0x14, reached at game over) scans the five 0x611C
 * object records for an active player slot and, finding none (all zero), takes the
 * record-neither -> loc_1475 arm. The real entry is therefore forced from that REAL loc_141E
 * dispatch by a single-byte upstream nudge — poking one 0x611C record to 3 makes loc_141E's
 * second scan hit and dispatch loc_144F. The captured entry is genuine (the ROM's own
 * loc_141E -> loc_144F dispatch), the only craft being that one upstream record byte — the
 * doc-06 crafted-entry technique, identical to equivalence-1459's ENTRY_A0 setup.
 *
 *   1. REALISM — capture the true loc_144F entry, replay oracle vs candidate on fresh
 *      clones, and prove RAM (ex-stack) + flip identical. Non-vacuous: assert the entry has
 *      the player index cleared (0x600D == 0x600E == 0) and that the oracle SETS both to 1,
 *      clears SUBSTATE_TIMER, advances GAME_SUBSTATE (0x14 -> 0x15), posts twelve tasks
 *      (tail +24), and sets flip = 0 | DIP. Candidate leaves SP/pc unchanged (no stack model).
 *
 *   2. CRAFTED (DIP matrix) — from the captured entry, poke DIP_UPRIGHT to 0 and 1
 *      identically on both sides. Because loc_144F forces the player key A = 0, the flip
 *      outcome is exactly DIP (0 -> latch off, 1 -> latch on) — the one arm the natural
 *      entry's single DIP value cannot exercise both of. Ring-edge behaviour (full/wrap) is
 *      the shared loc_1459 subtree, covered by equivalence-1459.
 *
 *   3. TEETH — four deliberately-broken twins the diff MUST catch: (a) skips the
 *      CURRENT_PLAYER write (RAM diff at 0x600D — the "select player 2" logic); (b) skips
 *      the 0x600E companion write (RAM diff at 0x600E); (c) enters the compose tail with
 *      A = 1 instead of 0 (the record==1 arm's key), caught via io.flipScreen on the DIP=0
 *      arm — the check RAM is blind to; (d) skips the compose delegation entirely (GAME_SUBSTATE
 *      never advances), proving the delegated subtree is present and gated.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-144f.test.js
