 * Equivalence test for loc_0cd4 (ROM 0x0CD4) — the 25m board-setup arm: select the 25m
 * girder layout table, queue the 25m background tune (SND_BGM = 8), then hand off to the
 * shared board-setup tail loc_0cc6 (walk the selected table into the playfield, the
 * 100m-only rivet stamp, and the rest of board setup).
 *
 * loc_0cd4 dissolves the oracle's tail jump `jp 0x0cc6` into a DIRECT call to the already-
 * idiomatic loc_0cc6, and hands the tail its layout pointer through the register image
 * (the tail's record walk reads DE). It WRITES memory through the whole shared tail, so it
 * is gated by clone / replay with a FRESH clone per case. The memory-equivalence contract
 * is RAM − STACK_SCRATCH: the oracle's push/call/ret traffic lands in the dead stack
 * region, which the compare excludes; the direct-call layer drops it entirely.
 *
 * Attract builds the 25m board, so it dispatches 0x0CD4 naturally (the board-1 setup arm,
 * BOARD == 1) — a real entry that runs the tail end-to-end. There is no unreached arm to
 * craft: this routine has a single path.
 *
 *   1. STRUCTURE — real board-1 entry: game-visible RAM identical to the oracle, and the
 *      oracle actually ran the arm+tail (SND_BGM queued to 8, SUBSTATE_TIMER armed to
 *      0x40, GAME_SUBSTATE advanced). stackDiffs > 0 proves the exclusion is load-bearing;
 *      entry SP is in STACK_SCRATCH.
 *   2. TEETH — two twins over loc_0cd4's two jobs: (a) queue the WRONG tune (9 not 8),
 *      caught at the tune latch; (b) select the WRONG layout table (the 50m conveyor
 *      table), caught in the drawn tilemap after the tail walks it.
 *   3. REALISM — hook 0x0CD4 over a long attract run and replay every real dispatch; each
 *      RAM − STACK identical to the oracle.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-0cd4.test.js
