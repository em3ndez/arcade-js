/**
 * Equivalence test for fillTileBlock (ROM 0x1826) — the 5×14 tilemap block fill.
 *
 * fillTileBlock WRITES memory (70 tilemap cells) and is a subroutine, not a pure
 * leaf, so it is gated by capture / clone / replay (docs/decompiler-pipeline). sub_1826 is UNREACHED
 * in attract — its five callers are the death / player-switch render (loc_12f2,
 * loc_1344) and the board-start intro-setup arms (loc_17b6, loc_1880), none of which
 * attract enters (probed: 0 dispatches of 0x1826 and of every caller over 4000
 * attract frames). It IS reached in driven gameplay, so the gate combines a real
 * driven capture with the crafted-entry breadth of the fillTileColumn (0x0F1B)
 * pattern.
 *
 * The sweep is complete rather than approximate because the routine READS NO
 * MEMORY: HL (the destination) is its entire input, so covering every real caller
 * value plus the region-crossing edges exhausts what can vary.
 *
 *   1. REAL (driven capture) — drive coin+start to GAME OVER; the game-over render
 *      (loc_12f2, counter==0) dispatches 0x1826 for real with the true live-in
 *      HL=0x76D4. Clone at that dispatch and confirm fillTileBlock leaves IDENTICAL
 *      game-visible RAM to the oracle, and models no stack (SP/pc unchanged). This
 *      is the gold-standard input — the exact state the running game produces.
 *
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted @ real caller HLs on real captured states) — capture real
 *      attract states at the VRAM-render sibling sub_0DA7 (literally the call made
 *      right after 0x1826 in loc_17b6 / loc_1880) and at the task primitive sub_309F
 *      (many varied machine environments). For each base × each real caller HL
 *      (0x76C6/CB/D0/D3/D4/D5/DA), run the ORACLE and fillTileBlock on independent
 *      FRESH clones (the routine mutates RAM) and confirm IDENTICAL game-visible RAM
 *      (diff confined to STACK_SCRATCH). Also confirm fillTileBlock models no stack:
 *      SP and pc unchanged from entry (the oracle's `ret` moves both; it pops but
 *      never writes the stack, so there is no stack-write residue at all here).
 *
 *   3. EQUAL (region-crossing crafts) — HLs that make the fill cross the
 *      VRAM↔sprite↔discard boundaries, identically on both sides, proving the mem
 *      write-seam and the `& 0xffff` row step match the oracle byte-for-byte on
 *      addresses the real callers never reach. (A true 16-bit wrap is not writable —
 *      every wrapped address is ROM/unmapped, which the write seam faults on both
 *      sides alike — so the defensive wrap is left as faithful-but-unexercised.)
 *
 *   4. TEETH (crafted) — a deliberately-broken twin that steps HL back by 0x24
 *      instead of 0x25 (a plausible off-by-one on the DE constant) shifts every row
 *      after the first. Over a sentinel-primed footprint it MUST be caught, and the
 *      caught diff must land inside the fill region.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-1826.test.js
