/**
 * Equivalence test for powerOnInit (ROM 0x01C3) — game state 0: the one-time
 * power-on initialization. Clears the screen, seeds the score slots + baseline
 * (ATTRACT/LEVEL/LIVES), unpacks the dip switches, raises flip-screen, advances
 * GAME_STATE to attract + selects the 25m board, and posts the three opening tasks.
 *
 * handler_01c3 is dispatched by the vblank NMI (perFrame, ROM 0x00CA) through the
 * GAME_STATE table — and GAME_STATE is 0 ONLY at reset, so it fires exactly once,
 * at boot, off a plain power-on. It WRITES memory through five decompiled callees
 * (clearPlayfieldAndSprites, drawLivesAndLevel, decodeDipSwitches, draw1UpLabel,
 * enqueueTask). So it is gated by MEMORY-equivalence against the frozen oracle
 * (RAM − STACK_SCRATCH), with a FRESH clone per case — never the full register
 * file, never cycles:
 *
 *   1. REALISM (real power-on dispatch) — boot a plain machine, hook 0x01C3, and
 *      clone the machine at the single real dispatch. Run the ORACLE on one clone
 *      and powerOnInit on another and prove game-visible RAM (everything outside the
 *      dead STACK_SCRATCH) is byte-identical. The real entry has an empty ring
 *      (tail 0xC0, slots 0xFF), so it exercises the plain no-wrap post arm. The
 *      idiomatic routine models no stack, so it must also leave SP and pc unchanged
 *      from entry (the oracle's calls + `ret` leave only push residue in STACK_SCRATCH).
 *
 *   2. CRAFTED (ring states boot never mints) — from the real entry, poke the task
 *      ring IDENTICALLY on both sides into arms the single boot dispatch never reaches:
 *        - FULL: occupy the tail slot (bit 7 clear) so every post is dropped and the
 *          tail is left untouched — only the baseline + screen state change.
 *        - WRAP: set TASK_TAIL near the top (0xFC) so the 6-byte batch wraps 0xFF→0xC0
 *          mid-batch, pinning enqueueTask's wrap math across the whole batch.
 *      Each compared oracle vs idiomatic on RAM − STACK_SCRATCH. (This routine is
 *      straight-line — no branches — so the one real entry already covers the whole
 *      control path; the crafts only broaden the shared enqueue primitive.)
 *
 *   3. TEETH — two deliberately-broken twins the diff MUST catch: (a) one that skips
 *      the GAME_STATE advance (a boot that never leaves state 0 — a hung machine),
 *      caught at 0x6005; (b) one that posts a wrong task argument, caught in the ring.
 *      A gate a real corruption slips through is worthless.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-01c3.test.js
