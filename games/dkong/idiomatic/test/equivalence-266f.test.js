 * Equivalence test for loc_266f (ROM 0x266F) — the "Y below 0xC0" arm of loc_262f: force
 * object-2's step-direction latch (M50_OBJ2_STEP_DIR, 0x62A3) negative unless its sign bit
 * is already set, then run the shared publish/animate tail (loc_264c).
 *
 * loc_266f WRITES MEMORY (the latch, on the not-yet-negative arm) and then tails into the
 * shared publish/animate routine, so it is gated on memory-equivalence — RAM (minus the dead
 * STACK_SCRATCH) + pc + SP. LIVE-OUT is memory-only: the tail's exit successor (sub_2AD3)
 * reloads the accumulator with Mario's X before reading it, so no register this routine
 * leaves is consumed downstream.
 *
 * The oracle is a tail-jump chain (loc_262f -> loc_266f -> the shared tail -> `ret`) that
 * nets exactly ONE caller-return pop. The idiomatic routine models the whole chain with
 * direct JS calls and a plain return (no stack modelling), so the harness performs ONE
 * m.ret() on the candidate AFTER the call to line pc + SP up with the oracle. Every nested
 * push the tail makes lands in STACK_SCRATCH and is excluded. Every case runs on FRESH clones
 * (the routine writes memory).
 *
 * Plain attract never dispatches 0x266F (0×): the whole sub_25F2 object cascade is board-2
 * gated (`ld a,0x02 / rst 0x30`) and attract plays 25m. So real dispatch states are
 * reproduced by running the TRANSLATED caller loc_262f on clones of a booted machine with
 * object-2's Y forced below 0xC0 (so loc_262f branches here) and 0x266F hooked to snapshot
 * each true entry — the same drive-the-caller technique the sibling 0x264C/0x268D tests use.
 * That capture also proves the sole caller enters with the latch pointer fixed at
 * M50_OBJ2_STEP_DIR, which is why this routine addresses that named cell directly.
 *
 *   1. REACHABILITY — 0x266F is dispatched 0× in a plain attract run (documents the
 *      non-executing board-2 frontier), yet driving loc_262f yields real entries for BOTH
 *      arms (latch sign clear and set).
 *   2. EQUAL (captured) — loc_266f == oracle on every real loc_262f dispatch, across both arms.
 *   3. EQUAL (crafted) — poke the latch sign (both arms, plus the 0x7F/0x80/0xC0 boundaries)
 *      and the frame counter (odd -> the tail's publish arm; even, low 5 bits != 0 -> the tail
 *      leaves the latch; even, low 5 bits == 0 -> the tail advances the sprite pair) on a real
 *      attract base; assert the full contract AND the intended effect (sign clear -> latch
 *      forced 0xFF; sign set -> latch untouched).
 *   4. TEETH — two broken twins, each MUST be caught:
 *      (a) inverted sign test (forces the latch when it is ALREADY negative) — caught at
 *          0x62A3 on a sign-set entry, where the oracle leaves the latch alone.
 *      (b) dropped force-negative write (never stamps 0xFF) — caught at 0x62A3 on a sign-clear
 *          entry, where the oracle forces the latch negative.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-266f.test.js
