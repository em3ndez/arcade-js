 * Equivalence test for runHitEffectInsteadOfPlay (ROM 0x1E8C) — the per-frame gate on the hit-effect latch
 * (0x6350). Latch clear: return true and the caller runs its ordinary per-frame gameplay
 * cascade. Latch set: run one beat of the effect through dispatchEffectSequenceStep (ROM 0x1E96),
 * then answer false through the skip tail loc_1e94 (ROM 0x1E94), which makes the caller abandon
 * the rest of the frame's update.
 *
 * THE CONTRACT. The real live-out is the caller-skip BOOLEAN (loc_197a consumes it as
 * `if (!runHitEffectInsteadOfPlay(m)) return;`) plus whatever memory the effect beat writes through the router.
 * SP/pc are the dropped stack model: the oracle's skip arm discards the caller's return address
 * and returns a level higher, all inside STACK_SCRATCH, while the rewrite carries that decision
 * in the boolean and touches no stack. So each case compares game-visible RAM (work + sprite +
 * video, minus STACK_SCRATCH) AND the boolean, on FRESH clones per side.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE ACTUALLY RUNS:
 *
 *   1. REALISM — BOTH ARMS OCCUR NATURALLY, so nothing is crafted for coverage. A plain
 *      4000-frame attract run (no coin, no pokes) with 0x1E8C hooked captures every real
 *      dispatch — 1970 of them, 1532 with the latch clear and 438 with it set — and each is
 *      replayed oracle-vs-idiomatic. The polarity is asserted per entry (true exactly when the
 *      latch read 0), and the entry SP is asserted to sit inside STACK_SCRATCH so excluding that
 *      region cannot mask a real diff.
 *
 *   2. EXHAUSTIVE (latch sweep) — poke the latch to all 256 values identically on both sides of
 *      three real bases: a latch-set one, and two latch-clear ones (one from before any effect
 *      has played, where a poked latch makes BOTH sides refuse in the router, and one from after,
 *      where all 255 nonzero values genuinely run a beat and write memory). This is the only
 *      thing that pins the gate as a zero/nonzero test: play produces only 0 and 1, so the
 *      captures alone cannot tell that reading from "== 1" (teeth (b) demonstrates exactly that
 *      blindness). The sweep asserts the observed shape too — the set of latch values that
 *      proceed is exactly {0}, and the two run-a-beat bases really do run 255 beats each.
 *
 *   3. TEETH — four deliberately-broken twins:
 *      (a) the gate inverted — caught on a real entry, on BOTH the boolean and RAM.
 *      (b) the gate narrowed to "== 1" — INVISIBLE to every captured dispatch (asserted here,
 *          not assumed) and caught by the sweep at latch value 2, on every one of the three
 *          bases. This is what proves the sweep's 256 values are load-bearing rather than
 *          decorative.
 *      (c) the effect beat dropped (skips without advancing the effect) — caught at
 *          EFFECT_SEQ_INNER on a real skip entry.
 *      (d) the skip dropped (runs the beat, then returns true) — RAM is IDENTICAL and only the
 *          boolean diverges, which is what proves the live-out assertion is doing work.
