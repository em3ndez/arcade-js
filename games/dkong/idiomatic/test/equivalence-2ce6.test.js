 * Equivalence test for loc_2ce6 (ROM 0x2CE6) — the entry point of the 0x2C-cluster chain.
 *
 * Its only ROM caller is the 25m barrel-release slot claim (ROM 0x2CB8), which leaves the pointer
 * register on BONUS — the byte it has just decremented — so loc_2ce6 reads the bonus counter for
 * this release. While four or more remain it does nothing; below four it zeroes the X field of the
 * record whose index EQUALS the remaining count, in the four-record sprite group at 0x69A8 (seeded
 * once per 25m board build from the ROM template at 0x3DDC and touched by no other ROM site).
 * Zeroing a sprite record's X blanks it. Both arms then continue into loc_2cf6, which presets the
 * freshly-claimed barrel record and falls on into the frame-gated renderer tick.
 *
 * CONTEXT, GROUNDED (live MAME 0.288 on the real dkong ROM, understanding pass 12,
 * scratchpad/pass12-grounding.md): this cluster is ORDINARY 25m BARREL PLAY, not a cutscene — the
 * older "0x2C-cluster cutscene renderer" framing is REFUTED. All 46 observed dispatches of the next
 * link, loc_2cf6, fell at gameplay substates (17 credited in-board 25m, 29 attract 25m demo) and
 * ZERO at substate 7, the opening Kong-climb cutscene; board 1 only; the index register held an
 * OBJ_ARRAY_67 barrel-record base at 46/46, each paired 1:1 with a slot claim at ROM 0x2CB8.
 * Grounding deliberately did NOT establish which NAMED Donkey Kong object either barrel kind is, so
 * no lore name is used here.
 *
 * loc_2ce6 WRITES MEMORY (its own record clear, and — through the continuation — everything the
 * loc_2cf6/loc_2d15 chain touches), so it is gated on memory-equivalence, not a returned scalar, and
 * every case runs on FRESH clones. The contract is RAM (minus STACK_SCRATCH) + pc + SP.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory-only, plus the control-flow boundary. loc_2ce6 pushes nothing of its own — both
 * exits are a jump/fall-through into loc_2cf6 — so the whole chain nets exactly ONE caller-return
 * pop, performed on loc_2ce6's behalf downstream. The idiomatic routine models that as a plain JS
 * return, so the harness performs one m.ret() on the candidate AFTER the call to line pc + SP up
 * with the oracle; the crafted cases additionally assert, non-vacuously, that both sides land on the
 * return address that was actually on the stack at entry with SP popped by exactly 2. No register is
 * asserted: loc_2cf6 overwrites the accumulator from BARREL_CLAIM_MODE and neither it nor loc_2d15
 * reads an incoming pointer register, so the oracle's counter/index/pointer residue is dead. On the
 * renderer's deeper table-load path the oracle's dissolved `call 0x004e` bracket churns the dead
 * STACK_SCRATCH region, which the contract excludes.
 *
 *   1. EQUAL (real captured dispatches) — hook 0x2CE6 in a real attract run and clone the machine at
 *      each true dispatch. Run the ORACLE on one clone and loc_2ce6 on another; confirm identical
 *      RAM (minus STACK_SCRATCH) + pc + SP. These all take the SKIP arm: the counter starts at 50 on
 *      25m level 1 and steps down one per barrel release, so attract never reaches 3.
 *
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted) — from a real captured dispatch, poke that ONE counter byte identically on
 *      both sides to force every clear index (0/1/2/3) and the 4 and 5 skip cases, over a
 *      sentinel-filled group so every write is unambiguous, plus one case that drives the
 *      continuation through the renderer's acting frame instead of its frame-gate return.
 *      Non-vacuity: the right record really was blanked on both sides, every other sentinel byte
 *      survived, and the barrel record downstream really was stamped.
 *
 *   3. TEETH — three broken twins, each MUST be caught:
 *      (a) wrong-stride — indexes the group with a 2-byte stride instead of the 4-byte sprite record
 *          stride, so it blanks the wrong record.
 *      (b) off-by-one boundary — clears at `remaining <= 4` instead of `< 4`, so at 4 it walks off
 *          the end of the group and blanks the first record of the neighbouring OBJ_65A0_SPRITES.
 *      (c) drop-continuation — does the (correct) record clear but returns WITHOUT continuing into
 *          loc_2cf6, so the barrel-record preset and the renderer's frame-gate decrement are missing.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-2ce6.test.js
