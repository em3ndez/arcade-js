/**
 * Memory-equivalence test for loc_0c92 (ROM 0x0C92) — the board builder: wipe the
 * playfield + sprite shadow buffer, reset the bonus readout BONUS_DISPLAY, post the opening deferred
 * task (opcode 5, argument 1), select palette bank 2 (0x7d86 -> 0, 0x7d87 -> 1), then
 * dispatch on BOARD to the per-board setup arm (25m/50m/75m, or the inline 100m-rivet
 * fall-through which raises palette bit0 to bank 3 and queues SND_BGM = 0x0B).
 *
 * This is the CYCLE-FREE / memory-equivalence gate (docs/decompiler-pipeline), not the
 * retired strict whole-machine one. The routine WRITES memory through its callees and the
 * setup continuation carries state, so every case uses a FRESH clone per side and the two
 * are compared on the go-forward contract:
 *
 *     RAM (dumpState, minus STACK_SCRATCH), PLUS the palette-bank output latch.
 *
 * The palette-bank latch is I/O device state (io.paletteBank), NOT part of dumpState
 * (work + sprite + video RAM only) — the display reads it to pick its colour set. It is
 * checked directly, alongside the RAM diff, so the routine's palette-bank job is not blind.
 *
 * pc and SP are deliberately NOT compared: the oracle models its CALL/RET brackets with
 * push16/step/ret (return addresses left in the dead stack region), the plumbing the
 * direct-call layer replaces with a JS return. Those pushes land inside STACK_SCRATCH, so
 * they are masked by the contract. A/HL and all flags are dead ABI: the caller reads no
 * return value. DE is set only as a live-IN (to enqueueTask and to the shared tail).
 *
 * REACHABILITY. Attract only ever builds the 25m board, so BOARD == 1 is a REAL captured
 * attract dispatch (unpoked). The 50m/75m/100m arms are 50m+ only, so they never dispatch
 * in a plain run; following the sanctioned "poke the board state to reach a state for
 * validation", the test forces each with an IDENTICAL-BOTH-SIDES board poke at frame 100
 * (GAME_STATE=3, GAME_SUBSTATE=0x0A board-setup, SUBSTATE_TIMER=1, BOARD=2/3/4); loc_0c92
 * then dispatches once under the vblank service with the real board, giving a REAL captured
 * entry (real register file, real stack).
 *
 * Jobs:
 *   1. EQUAL — for every board 1..4, oracle vs loc_0c92 on fresh clones of the real entry
 *      leave identical RAM (−STACK_SCRATCH) and identical palette bank. Both clones are
 *      pre-seeded with a distinct sentinel palette bank AND a sentinel BONUS_DISPLAY, so
 *      the match proves the writes actually happened (not unchanged bytes). Non-vacuous:
 *      the oracle side shows the whole chain ran (BONUS_DISPLAY cleared, SND_BGM + palette bank
 *      at the board's values), and the idiomatic side genuinely reproduced them. The dead
 *      stack traffic is proven load-bearing to the mask (stackDiffs > 0), and entry SP sits
 *      in STACK_SCRATCH so the exclusion is sound.
 *   2. TEETH (palette) — a twin that DROPS the two palette-bank writes leaves the sentinel
 *      bank; MUST be caught at the palette-bank latch. Proves the latch writes are load-
 *      bearing (they are invisible to the RAM diff).
 *   3. TEETH (dispatch) — a twin that mis-routes a board-1 entry to the 50m arm draws a
 *      DIFFERENT board and queues the wrong tune; MUST be caught in RAM at SND_BGM.
 *   4. TEETH (rivet tune) — a twin that queues the wrong background tune on the 100m-rivet
 *      arm (0x0A instead of 0x0B) MUST be caught at SND_BGM.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-0c92.test.js
