/**
 * stepBarrelRight — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x1FE5: the forward horizontal
 * step of the OBJ_ARRAY_67 object sweep.
 * GATE:  captured + crafted + live, ATTRACT ONLY. Every real dispatch in a 3000-frame attract
 *        run is replayed — no sampling — and three crafted arms cover the X values attract
 *        never presents. Attract is 25m only and fills only record slots 0-6, so slots 7-9,
 *        the other boards and credited gameplay are NOT covered.
 *
 * The routine has four acts: swap to the shadow register set, stage two values the
 * still-frozen shared tail at ROM 0x1FF6 consumes (a step selector and a selector-bit
 * byte), increment the object record's OBJ_X, and run that tail. The tail is where all
 * the visible work happens, so this gate is mostly a gate on the FOUR INPUTS the tail is
 * handed — which is what the teeth below are chosen to pin.
 *
 * CONTRACT COMPARED HERE: work/sprite/video RAM minus STACK_SCRATCH plus the return
 * value — the required memory-equivalence contract — and, as EXTRAS that happen to hold
 * for this routine, pc, SP and the FULL register file. The extras hold for a derivable
 * reason: this routine models no stack of its own (the oracle has no push/pop either)
 * and the frozen tail it hands to runs the whole rest of the sweep, rewriting every
 * register and returning through the same `ret`. So the only thing this rewrite really
 * drops is the FLAG state its increment leaves at the moment the tail is entered, which
 * the tail overwrites before its first conditional — measured by test 5, not assumed.
 *
 * WHY THE ENTRIES ARE REHOSTED. A capture is cloned from a machine that carries the
 * capturing override, and clone() reruns the constructor, so a clone carries it too.
 * This routine's tail RE-ENTERS 0x1FE5 for the sweep's remaining slots, so replaying on
 * a plain clone would re-trigger the capture hook and clone the machine again, over and
 * over. Every entry is therefore rehosted into a FRESH override-free Machine, which also
 * means the nested re-entries run the oracle on both sides and the comparison isolates
 * the ONE outermost dispatch.
 *
 * WHAT EACH TEST ACTUALLY COVERS — read this before trusting a green run:
 *
 *   1. CAPTURED (real dispatches). 0x1FE5 is dispatched 2775 times in a 3000-frame
 *      attract run and ALL 2775 are replayed — no sampling, so there is no sampling
 *      policy to be wrong about. The test reports the entry shapes it saw. Attract is
 *      25m only and only ever fills slots 0-6 of the ten-record array, so the captures
 *      say nothing about slots 7-9, the other boards, or gameplay.
 *
 *   2. CRAFTED (the X values attract never presents). Attract only ever enters with an
 *      X in 0x2A..0xE3, measured over those same 2775 dispatches, so three arms are
 *      crafted by poking THAT ONE BYTE on a real
 *      captured machine: X=255 (the increment wraps to 0), X=0x10 (below the tail's low
 *      threshold) and X=0x02 (stepping onto the tail's every-eighth-pixel gate). The
 *      base is a real capture, stack included — that is why no return address is pushed
 *      here; the tail chain unwinds through the caller frames the capture already has.
 *      Each arm asserts WHICH tail arm the poke actually reached (ROM 0x202F / 0x215F
 *      dispatch counts), so a poke that changed nothing would fail as vacuous.
 *
 *   3. LIVE (whole-machine). The rewrite is wired at 0x1FE5 for a 3000-frame attract run
 *      and every frame's state dump is compared against the all-oracle baseline, minus
 *      STACK_SCRATCH. THE OVERRIDE RESTORES THE ORACLE'S MEASURED CYCLE COST (measured
 *      per dispatch by running the oracle on a throwaway rehost): cycle-free code
 *      under-charges, which shifts the vblank NMI. Without the restoration this same run
 *      forks on the spin counter at 0x6019 at frame 710, for reasons that have nothing
 *      to do with this routine. The test asserts the restored delta is the same on every
 *      one of the 2775 dispatches — it is the fixed 47 T-states of the four instructions
 *      this rewrite drops. Attract only; gameplay is NOT covered by any test here.
 *
 *   4. LIVE-OUT. A twin identical to the rewrite except that it scrambles the flags
 *      immediately before entering the tail — i.e. the exact state this rewrite drops,
 *      at the exact point it drops it — is wired live for the same 3000-frame run. The
 *      trace stays byte-identical, so nothing downstream reads those flags. Attract only.
 *
 *   5. TEETH — seven deliberately-broken twins the cases above MUST catch:
 *        (a) the register-set swap dropped;
 *        (b) the step decremented instead of incremented;
 *        (c) the mirror branch's staged pair (0xFF / 4) instead of this branch's (1 / 0);
 *        (d) the step applied to OBJ_Y instead of OBJ_X;
 *        (e) the step selector left unstaged;
 *        (f) the selector bits left unstaged;
 *        (g) a saturating increment instead of a wrapping one.
 *      (e) and (f) are the ones that pin this routine's whole reason for existing, and
 *      each fails at a DIFFERENT cell — (e) at the record's Y, (f) at its sprite code —
 *      which is the check behind what the routine's header says the two values feed.
 *
