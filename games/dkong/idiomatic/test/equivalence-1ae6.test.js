 * Equivalence test for loc_1ae6 (ROM 0x1AE6) — the RIGHT arm of Mario's on-foot movement
 * dispatch: ask the horizontal position gate for its (D,E) verdict, read the control word once,
 * and spend the frame on a rightward walk step only when E says the right-hand limit is clear
 * AND Right is held; otherwise hand the frame to the left/climb arm at 0x1AF5 (now idiomatic too).
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE ACTUALLY RUNS (five tests, in order):
 *
 *   0. REACHABILITY — hook 0x1AE6 in a plain 3000-frame attract run (no coin, no pokes) and
 *      count the real dispatches and the arm each one takes. This is the number the routine
 *      header quotes; it is produced here, not asserted from memory.
 *
 *   1. EQUAL (real dispatches) — replay every captured entry: oracle vs candidate on
 *      RAM − STACK_SCRATCH + pc + SP.
 *
 *   2. R IS DEAD ABI — the oracle takes a second argument (dispatchMarioMovement's IX-relative address
 *      helper) that the candidate drops. Run the oracle WITH and WITHOUT it on every captured
 *      entry and require the contract to be identical, which is what licenses the drop.
 *
 *   3. EQUAL (crafted) — the right-limit block. Attract never produces it: MARIO_X stays under
 *      0xEA for every captured dispatch, so E is 0 every time and the E == 1 arm has ZERO real
 *      captures — stated plainly because the "real dispatch" coverage above genuinely does not
 *      reach it. It is covered by poking MARIO_X on a real Right-held base, identically on both
 *      sides: 0xE9 still walks, 0xEA and 0xF0 do not. That pins the threshold, and the
 *      assertions check the ORACLE's own behaviour flips, so the case is not vacuous.
 *
 *   4. TEETH — three deliberately-broken twins the same contract must CATCH:
 *        (a) ignores the right-limit verdict (walks whenever Right is held);
 *        (b) tests control bit 1 (Left) instead of bit 0 (Right);
 *        (c) omits staging the control word in the accumulator before the 0x1AF5 hand-off,
 *            which is the one register genuinely live across that hand-off (loc_1af5 still
 *            takes both inputs in the register file, so the ABI survives the dissolve).
 *
 * THE STACK CONTRACT. Both oracle arms net exactly one caller return. The candidate is now
 * idiomatic END TO END on BOTH arms — 0x1AF5 landed in the same batch and is direct-called — so
 * neither arm touches the guest stack, and the harness applies one m.ret() to the candidate
 * exactly when its body left SP where it found it, the same rule the live seam uses. (Until
 * 0x1AF5 was wired, the hand-off arm ran the frozen oracle and had already performed that
 * return; the SP-based rule covers both eras without change, which is why it is written as a
 * condition rather than as an arm-specific constant.) The dissolved call bracket
 * and the tail chains churn only STACK_SCRATCH (real dispatches sit at SP ~0x6bea), which the
 * memory-equivalence contract excludes.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-1ae6.test.js
