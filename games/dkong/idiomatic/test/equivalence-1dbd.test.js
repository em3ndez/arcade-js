/**
 * Equivalence test for loc_1dbd (ROM 0x1DBD) — the router for the effect-sprite state
 * machine held in 0x6340. It reads the state byte and hands the frame to one of three
 * handlers: state 0 -> loc_1e49 (idle no-op), state 1 -> loc_1dc9 (arm + advance), state 2
 * -> loc_1e4a (countdown). State 3 is the reset vector and is never produced in play.
 *
 * loc_1dbd writes no memory itself; every visible byte is the chosen handler's. Its state-1
 * arm runs loc_1dc9's full effect chain (which the idiomatic side reaches through the
 * fully-idiomatic loc_1dc9, the oracle side through its return-modelling chain), so SP/pc
 * and the STACK_SCRATCH region diverge there and are dead (the caller reads no register).
 * The gate is therefore memory-equivalence on RAM − STACK_SCRATCH (never the full register
 * file, never cycles, never SP/pc), a FRESH clone per case because the handlers write memory
 * and advance the task ring:
 *
 *   1. REALISM — hook 0x1dbd in a real attract run and clone at each dispatch. Attract
 *      naturally exercises all three reachable states (idle/arm/countdown). For each real
 *      entry, run the ORACLE on one fresh clone and idiomatic loc_1dbd on another; every
 *      game-visible byte matches (residual confined to the dead STACK_SCRATCH). The
 *      oracle's deepest stack use is asserted to sit inside STACK_SCRATCH so excluding the
 *      region cannot mask a real diff.
 *
 *   2. CRAFTED (state sweep) — on real captured bases, poke 0x6340 to each of {0,1,2}
 *      identically on both sides and compare RAM − STACK_SCRATCH. This drives every
 *      reachable arm deterministically even though attract already reaches them.
 *
 *   3. CRAFTED (reset vector) — poke 0x6340 to 3 (the reset-vector slot) identically on
 *      both sides and assert BOTH the oracle and idiomatic loc_1dbd throw, matching the
 *      defensive behaviour for the untranslated target.
 *
 *   4. TEETH — two deliberately-broken routers, each caught by the state sweep:
 *      (a) the state-2 handler dropped to a no-op — misses the countdown, caught at 0x6341;
 *      (b) the state-1 handler dropped to a no-op — misses the effect one-shot, caught at
 *      the effect sound latch 0x6085.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-1dbd.test.js
