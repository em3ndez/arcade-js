 * Equivalence test for drawCreditLineInAttract (ROM 0x0611) — the attract-gated
 * "CREDIT nn" repaint (task-table entry 8).
 *
 * entry_0611 is a one-bit enable guard in front of drawCreditDisplay (0x0616): it reads
 * ATTRACT (0x6007) and, on the low bit CLEAR (a credited game is in progress), returns
 * without touching anything; on the bit SET (attract) it falls through into drawCreditDisplay
 * to repaint the credit line. Attract keeps the bit set, so the game naturally dispatches it
 * only on the PAINT path; the credited-game skip path is reached with a crafted entry.
 *
 * The contract is MEMORY-ONLY (RAM − STACK_SCRATCH). This is a task-table entry: the
 * dispatcher discards its registers/flags, so nothing is live-out but memory. And the two
 * paths do not net the same stack motion — the skip path returns (pops the caller address)
 * while the paint path falls through a nested call that never nets a pop — so there is no
 * single terminal `ret` that lines pc/SP up on both arms (unlike equivalence-0350). Since
 * the idiomatic routine drops the oracle's fall-through call bracket, the oracle's transient
 * stack writes are excluded via STACK_SCRATCH, exactly the dissolved-call case.
 *
 * Because attract paints "00" over "00", a broken twin that paints when it should not would
 * be invisible against a base that already shows the same digits. So every crafted entry
 * pre-stamps a SENTINEL tile into the two credit-digit cells (0x74BF high, 0x749F low): a
 * real paint overwrites it (observable), and a skip leaves it (so an unwanted paint diverges).
 *
 *   1. REACHABILITY — hook 0x0611 in a real attract run and confirm the game dispatches it
 *      (the credit line is repainted through the task queue during attract).
 *
 *   2. EQUAL (captured) — clone the machine at each real dispatch and confirm
 *      drawCreditLineInAttract reproduces the oracle's RAM over every real state.
 *
 *   3. EQUAL (crafted) — pin BOTH arms identically on both sides: the credited-game skip
 *      (writes nothing) and the attract paint over several credit counts (00 / 12 / 99, and
 *      an ATTRACT byte with high bits set to prove only bit 0 matters). Non-vacuity is
 *      asserted: the paint arms change the digit cells, the skip arm changes nothing.
 *
 *   4. TEETH — two broken twins the SAME suite (captured + crafted) MUST catch:
 *        (a) inverted guard — paints during a game and skips in attract; caught on every
 *            paint case (the sentinel survives where the oracle painted).
 *        (b) unconditional paint — drops the guard; caught on the skip case (it paints over
 *            the sentinel where the oracle left it).
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-0611.test.js
