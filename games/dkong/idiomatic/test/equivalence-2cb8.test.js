 * Equivalence test for releaseBarrelIntoFreeSlot (ROM 0x2CB8) — the 25m barrel-release slot claim.
 *
 * The scan above it (ROM 0x2C8F) walks the ten OBJ_ARRAY_67 barrel records counting down and
 * jumps here on the first record whose low two flag bits are clear. This routine turns that free
 * slot into a released barrel: it publishes the record as RENDER_OBJ_PTR, stamps its OBJ_ACTIVE
 * field with 2 ("occupied"), stores the matching ACTOR_SPRITES slot into RENDER_DST_PTR (the
 * scan's countdown runs 10..1 across records 0..9, so ten-minus-the-count is the record index),
 * latches the cluster's event gate (0x6393), posts the deferred "step the bonus readout down one
 * notch" task, decrements BONUS — on 25m the barrel release IS the bonus tick — and raises
 * BONUS_EXPIRED_STEP if that reaches zero. It then continues into loc_2ce6 with the counter's
 * address in the pointer register.
 *
 * CONTEXT, GROUNDED (live MAME 0.288 on the real dkong ROM, understanding pass 12,
 * scratchpad/pass12-grounding.md §2): this cluster is ORDINARY 25m BARREL PLAY, not a cutscene —
 * the older "0x2C-cluster cutscene renderer" framing is REFUTED. All 46 observed dispatches of
 * the downstream stampReleasedBarrelKind fell at gameplay substates (17 credited in-board 25m,
 * 29 attract 25m demo) and ZERO at substate 7, the opening Kong-climb cutscene; board 1 only;
 * each was preceded in the SAME frame by a slot claim here (46/46, none unmatched either way)
 * with the scan's countdown walking 10, 9, 8, 7…; and the claimed record was an OBJ_ARRAY_67
 * barrel record every time. A freshly claimed record was watched sitting at OBJ_ACTIVE == 2 for
 * ~28 frames before flipping to 1 when it started moving. Grounding deliberately did NOT
 * establish which NAMED Donkey Kong object either barrel kind is, so no lore name is used here.
 *
 * releaseBarrelIntoFreeSlot WRITES MEMORY (its own claim, the task ring, the bonus, and — through the
 * continuation — everything the loc_2ce6 / stampReleasedBarrelKind / advanceBarrelRelease chain touches), so
 * it is gated on memory-equivalence, not a returned scalar, and every case runs on FRESH clones.
 * The contract is RAM (minus STACK_SCRATCH) + pc + SP.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT: memory-only, plus the control-flow boundary. releaseBarrelIntoFreeSlot pushes nothing of its own that
 * survives (its `call 0x309F` bracket balances; its exit is a jump into loc_2ce6), and the chain
 * nets exactly ONE caller-return pop, performed downstream on its behalf. The idiomatic routine
 * models that as a plain JS return, so the harness performs one m.ret() on the candidate AFTER
 * the call to line pc + SP up with the oracle; the crafted cases additionally assert,
 * non-vacuously, that both sides land on the return address that was actually on the stack at
 * entry with SP popped by exactly 2. No register is asserted: every register the oracle leaves
 * (the scaled index, the computed pointers, the accumulator) is overwritten downstream before it
 * is read, and the scan's callers read none of them. The dead STACK_SCRATCH region — churned by
 * the oracle's dissolved `call 0x309F` bracket and by the downstream chain's `call 0x004E` — is
 * excluded by the contract.
 *
 *   0. REACHABILITY — hook 0x2CB8 in a plain attract run and measure: how many natural
 *      dispatches, which slot indices the scan's countdown reaches, the BONUS range, and whether
 *      the bonus-expiry arm is ever taken. Also asserts the claimed record really is
 *      OBJ_ARRAY_67 + index*0x20 at every dispatch, which is what makes "ten-minus-the-count is
 *      the record index" an observation rather than a reading of the caller.
 *
 *   1. EQUAL (real captured dispatches) — clone the machine at each true dispatch, run the
 *      ORACLE on one clone and releaseBarrelIntoFreeSlot on another, confirm identical RAM (minus STACK_SCRATCH)
 *      + pc + SP. These cover 8 of the 10 slot indices and none of the expiry arm.
 *
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted) — from a real captured dispatch, poke ONE byte identically on both sides:
 *      (a) every slot index 0..9, including the two attract never reaches, plus an exhaustive
 *          256-value sweep of the countdown that pins the slot arithmetic over its whole byte
 *          range;
 *      (b) an exhaustive 256-value sweep of BONUS, which reaches the bonus-expiry arm attract
 *          never does (the counter never fell below 37 in 14000 frames);
 *      (c) one case that drives the continuation through the renderer's acting frame instead of
 *          its frame-gate return, so the RENDER_DST_PTR this routine computes is actually
 *          dereferenced by stepBarrelAlongReleasePath.
 *      Non-vacuity: the claim, the two pointers, the gate latch, the posted task message, the
 *      new counter and the expiry latch are each asserted on BOTH sides.
 *
 *   3. TEETH — five broken twins, each MUST be caught:
 *      (a) wrong slot index — uses the countdown itself instead of ten-minus-the-countdown, so
 *          RENDER_DST_PTR names the wrong sprite slot.
 *      (b) wrong claim value — marks the record active (1) instead of occupied (2), so the next
 *          scan would treat it as a live barrel rather than a claimed slot.
 *      (c) dropped expiry latch — never raises BONUS_EXPIRED_STEP when the counter hits zero.
 *      (d) dropped task post — decrements the counter but never posts the readout task.
 *      (e) dropped continuation — does the whole claim but returns without continuing into
 *          loc_2ce6, so the downstream preset and renderer tick are missing.
 *
 * OBSERVED FAILING against the real candidate, not only against the twins. Injecting an
 * off-by-one into releaseBarrelIntoFreeSlot's slot index fails three separate cases here —
 * the captured-dispatch job (`RAM@0x62ac oracle=128 cand=124`), the exhaustive countdown
 * sweep (`countdown 1: RAM@0x62ac oracle=164 cand=160`) and the BONUS sweep (`bonus 0:
 * RAM@0x62ac oracle=128 cand=124`) — and the teeth job independently reports each of the five
 * twins' first divergence, including the dropped expiry latch at `RAM@0x6386 oracle=1 cand=0`,
 * which only the crafted BONUS sweep reaches because attract never drives the counter to zero.
