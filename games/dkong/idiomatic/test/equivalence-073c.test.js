 * Equivalence test for runAttractState (ROM 0x073C) — the attract game-state handler. It
 * writes GAME_SUBSTATE/GAME_STATE and, on the no-credit branch, dispatches a sub-state
 * handler, so it is gated by capture/clone/replay, not an exhaustive-leaf sweep:
 *   1. EQUAL (real captured dispatches) — clone at a strided set of true 0x073C dispatches;
 *      run the oracle on one clone and runAttractState on another; assert RAM(−STACK_SCRATCH)
 *      identical. No-credit dispatches also assert SP/pc match the oracle (the callee's `ret`
 *      sets them) for every sub-state EXCEPT death (4): slot 4 tail-dispatches the now-DISSOLVED
 *      dispatchDeathAnimationPhase, which no longer seats the oracle's rst-0x28 guest return, so
 *      its SP/pc differ while RAM stays identical — perFrame resets SP and the whole-game
 *      SP-inertness tests carry that guard.
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted) — forces CREDIT and every sub-state 0-7 on one captured entry, RAM-equal
 *      both sides; the CREDIT arm also asserts runAttractState leaves SP/pc unchanged from entry.
 *   3. TEETH — a twin reading the index from GAME_STATE (0x6005) not GAME_SUBSTATE (0x600A) must
 *      be caught by the captured sweep.
 * Known holes: the stride-16 sweep can step over a single-frame divergence (re-run at stride 1
 * for an interchangeability claim); slot 5 is never captured, so its SP is asserted nowhere.
