/**
 * Equivalence test for loc_3fa0 (ROM 0x3FA0) — the board-setup prelude: stamp the
 * 50m-only tiles (stamp50mBoardTiles), then run the board-setup continuation
 * (loc_0d5f).
 *
 * The routine WRITES memory through both callees and the continuation has state, so
 * it is gated by clone / replay with a FRESH clone per case. The memory-equivalence
 * contract is RAM − STACK_SCRATCH: the oracle's return-address and call-chain stack
 * traffic lands in the dead stack region, which the compare excludes; the direct-call
 * layer drops it entirely.
 *
 * Attract sets up 25m ONLY, so it dispatches 0x3FA0 with BOARD == 1, where the 50m
 * applicability gate is CLOSED (no tile writes) and only the continuation runs. That
 * one real entry validates the glue on the gate-closed path; the gate-OPEN arm and
 * the other continuation arms are reached by a Karl-sanctioned BOARD poke (2/3/4)
 * applied identically on both sides of the real entry.
 *
 *   1. STRUCTURE — on the real board-1 entry, game-visible RAM (RAM − STACK_SCRATCH)
 *      is identical, and the oracle actually did the continuation work (SUBSTATE_TIMER
 *      armed to 0x40, GAME_SUBSTATE advanced). stackDiffs > 0 proves the exclusion is
 *      load-bearing, and the entry SP sits in STACK_SCRATCH.
 *
 *   2. BOARDS (crafted) — BOARD poked to 1/2/3/4 identically on both sides: RAM − STACK
 *      identical per board, plus the observable 50m stamp on the oracle side when the
 *      gate opens (board 2: the four cells become 0x10/0xC0/0x10/0xC0).
 *
 *   3. TEETH — two twins targeting loc_3fa0's two jobs: (a) skipping the tile stamp,
 *      caught on the 50m board at one of the stamp cells; (b) skipping the
 *      continuation, caught with the setup timer left unarmed.
 *
 *   4. REALISM — hook 0x3FA0 over a long attract run and replay every real dispatch;
 *      at least one occurs (25m board build), each RAM − STACK identical to the oracle.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-3fa0.test.js
