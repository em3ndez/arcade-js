 * Equivalence test for dispatchBoardOverlapSearch (ROM 0x3E88) — select the current board's
 * object-overlap arm by BOARD and return its severity code, handing the probe point and the
 * caller's bounds word to the arm as arguments.
 *
 * The dissolved dispatcher is a local switch (OVERLAP_HANDLERS keyed by BOARD) returning the arm's
 * severity; it opens no guest stack. It is NEVER dispatched during attract, so all coverage is
 * CRAFTED on a real attract-base machine (so work RAM is self-consistent), poking BOARD (0x6227) to
 * pick the arm and seating the probe inputs the way the caller does:
 *
 *   1. SELECTOR — pin the board->arm map identity (boards 1-4: loc_3e99 / search50m / search75m /
 *      search100m) and that every other selector is a never-reached guard slot the dispatcher
 *      throws on.
 *
 *   2. REAL ARM (crafted) — run the board-1..4 arms FOR REAL against the frozen oracle, comparing
 *      RAM(−stack) + the returned severity (pc/SP are seam artifacts of the oracle's trampoline
 *      unwind and are not compared). Board 1 is also run with a hand-activated overlap object so the
 *      search actually COUNTS (OVERLAP_COUNT tracks the L byte of the handed-off bounds) — proving
 *      the bounds word genuinely reaches the arm.
 *
 *   3. NULL GUARD (crafted) — boards 0 and 5 are the reset-vector guards; the frozen oracle throws
 *      NotImplemented(0x0000) and the dissolved dispatcher throws on the guard slot. Assert BOTH
 *      throw (the messages differ, so only that both throw is asserted).
 *
 *   4. TEETH — two deliberately-broken twins, each MUST be caught:
 *      (a) ignore-board (always runs the 100m arm) — caught on board 2 by the full-handler contract
 *          (different array/count, so OBJ_SEARCH_COUNT diverges).
 *      (b) corrupt-severity (returns the code off by one) — caught by the returned severity.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-3e88.test.js
