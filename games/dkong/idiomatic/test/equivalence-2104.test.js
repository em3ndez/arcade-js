/**
 * Memory-equivalence gate for retireBarrelAtEndOfRange (ROM 0x2104) — the object-record X limit: retire the
 * record (zero OBJ_ACTIVE and OBJ_X) when its X has run down into the bottom of the range,
 * otherwise hand it on untouched. Both arms leave for good through a still-frozen hand-off
 * target (ROM 0x1FCE above the limit, ROM 0x21BA at it), so the rewrite keeps the oracle's
 * calls to both and forwards what they return.
 *
 * WHAT IT ACTUALLY COVERS — read this before trusting a green run:
 *
 *   0. REACHABILITY — the census that decides everything below: 0x2104 is dispatched 382
 *      times in a 6000-frame attract run, on OBJ_ARRAY_67 records 0 and 1 only, with X only
 *      ever in 59..72. EVERY ONE takes the above-the-limit arm. The retire arm, the boundary
 *      values and the wrap are therefore NOT covered by attract at all and are crafted.
 *
 *   1. EQUAL (captured, inline) — every dispatch is replayed, not a sample: at each one the
 *      host clones the entry state, runs the oracle on one clone and the rewrite on another,
 *      compares, and discards. Because both hand-off targets tail back into the caller's
 *      ten-record sweep, each replay runs the REST of that sweep as well, and the comparison
 *      covers all of it. Contract: work/sprite/video RAM outside STACK_SCRATCH, the forwarded
 *      return value, pc and SP. pc and SP are asserted because this rewrite keeps the oracle's
 *      hand-off calls and models no stack of its own, so they legitimately hold here.
 *
 *   2. ISOLATED (captured) — the same dispatches replayed with BOTH hand-off targets replaced
 *      by stubs that log their address and return a sentinel. That cuts the sweep off after
 *      this routine, so what is compared is exactly this routine's own write set, the target
 *      it chose, and whether it forwarded the target's return value. The stubs are installed
 *      on each fresh clone (a stub does not survive clone()) and the test asserts each replay
 *      logged exactly one hand-off, so a dead stub cannot pass as a live one.
 *
 *   3. EQUAL (crafted) — thirteen X values poked onto a REAL captured entry, both sides
 *      identically: the retire arm (0, 1, 7), both sides of the limit (8, 9, 15, 16, 17), the
 *      wrap (248, 249, 255) and its far side (247), plus one natural value as a control.
 *
 *   4. TEETH — five broken twins, each of which MUST be caught, and the test records which
 *      half caught it: an inverted limit (captured), a swallowed hand-off return (isolated,
 *      captured), a dropped margin, a dropped wrap, and a retire arm that forgets to zero X
 *      (the last three reachable only from the crafted entries).
 *
 *   5. LIVE-WIRE — the rewrite wired live at 0x2104 for a whole 2000-frame attract run, with
 *      the oracle's own head instruction timing replayed per dispatch, diffed against the
 *      all-oracle baseline over the FULL state dump including STACK_SCRATCH. The dispatch
 *      count is asserted non-zero and equal to the census, so the arm cannot pass by never
 *      running. A CONTROL run without the timing replay shows the same wiring does fork,
 *      which is what makes the green run above mean something.
 *
 * NOT COVERED: attract only, plus pokes on top of attract state. No credited game, no board
 * other than 25m, and no record base other than the two attract drives.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT, DERIVED — cross-file, and therefore recorded here rather than in the routine. Exactly
 * two sites reach 0x2104, both frozen (the branch at ROM 0x20F7, and the fall-through at the end of
 * ROM 0x2101); both are tail hand-offs, so neither reads a register back — and the two hand-off
 * targets overwrite the accumulator before reading it and set their own flags before testing any,
 * which is why the residual registers and flags are dropped.
 *
 * THE GAME READING, corroborated across files and therefore recorded here: the sibling gate at ROM
 * 0x24B4, which the caller at ROM 0x2101 runs immediately before falling in here, makes the SAME
 * two writes (+0 and +3, both zero) once the record's position lands in the window it watches, and
 * then joins the same shared tail. Two independent bodies agree on the idiom. NOT CLAIMED: the
 * identity of the objects that reach here — attract only ever dispatches this on OBJ_ARRAY_67
 * records 0 and 1.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-2104.test.js
