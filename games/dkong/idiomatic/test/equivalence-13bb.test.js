 * Equivalence test for loc_13bb (ROM 0x13bb) — the player-1 half of the in-game
 * player/display context reset: CURRENT_PLAYER(0x600D)=0, JOIN_VALUE_LO(0x600E)=0,
 * GAME_SUBSTATE(0x600A)=0, and the flip-screen latch 0x7D82=1 (upright). NB the byte
 * cleared at 0x600E is the join-value low byte, NOT TWO_PLAYER_GAME (which is 0x600F,
 * the high byte, and is not written here).
 *
 * loc_13bb WRITES memory (three work-RAM bytes) and the flip-screen board latch, and
 * READS nothing — it is a CONSTANT function of no inputs. So it is validated by
 * capture/clone/replay on a FRESH clone per case (docs/decompiler-pipeline) — never reusing one machine
 * for a case that writes memory, never the full register file, never cycles. The
 * compared contract is:
 *
 *   RAM (minus STACK_SCRATCH)  +  io.flipScreen (the 0x7D82 latch)
 *
 * The flip-screen latch is a board io output, NOT in the RAM dump, so comparing
 * io.flipScreen is load-bearing (a skipped flip-set is invisible to the RAM gate). No
 * live-out registers/flags (the rst-0x28 sub-state dispatch consumes none; the oracle's
 * residual A=1 is dead ABI); SP/PC are not compared — the idiomatic layer drops the
 * oracle's `ret` stack/PC bookkeeping (JS call stack).
 *
 * A 6000-frame attract run dispatches 0x13bb ZERO times, and so do 1P and 2P coin+start
 * runs (its sub-state is reached only in a credited game's player-switch path). So —
 * exactly as docs/decompiler-pipeline prescribes for arms attract never reaches — the gate is CRAFTED
 * from real booted machines with a surgical nudge, and because the routine has no inputs
 * the sweep is effectively exhaustive over its behaviour:
 *
 *   1. STRUCTURE — on a crafted entry, confirm game-visible RAM (ex-stack) + flip are
 *      identical to the oracle, that the oracle's `ret` pop target sits inside
 *      STACK_SCRATCH (so excluding the stack cannot mask a real diff), and that the
 *      idiomatic side models neither SP nor pc.
 *
 *   2. CONSTANT (diverse bases) — over several diverse real attract states, with all
 *      four outputs (600D/600E/600A + io.flipScreen) PRE-DIRTIED to sentinels identically
 *      on both sides, confirm RAM (ex-stack) + flip identical to the oracle AND that the
 *      oracle produced the fixed outcome (0/0/0, flip=1). Proves the output is
 *      input-independent and both agree — a dropped write cannot hide behind a stale value.
 *
 *   3. TEETH — three deliberately-broken twins MUST be caught: (a) a wrong CURRENT_PLAYER
 *      store (RAM diff at 0x600D); (b) a SKIPPED flip-set that leaves flip OFF
 *      (io.flipScreen diff — the check the RAM gate is blind to); (c) a SKIPPED
 *      TWO_PLAYER_GAME write (RAM diff at 0x600E).
 *
 *   4. REALISM — hook 0x13bb over a long attract run; replay any real dispatch, else
 *      record that attract never reaches this sub-state (why crafted is the gate).
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-13bb.test.js
