 * Equivalence test for loc_30fa (ROM 0x30FA) — the selector that picks one of the four
 * frame gates at ROM 0x3110-0x313B by DIFFICULTY and passes its proceed/skip decision up.
 *
 * loc_30fa reads exactly one byte of its own (DIFFICULTY, 0x6380), clamps it to the six
 * entries of its ROM table, and runs the gate that entry names; the gate reads FRAME
 * (0x601A) and answers proceed or skip. Nothing on that path writes RAM, so the live-out is
 * the returned decision plus "no memory moved outside the dead stack scratch". Both sides
 * run the WHOLE chain — the oracle through the ROM table and the frozen gates, the candidate
 * through its JS table and the idiomatic gates — so a wrong table entry, a wrong clamp, or a
 * wrong gate is caught end to end. No callee is stubbed anywhere in this file.
 *
 * NOT RECURSIVE. The brief for this routine warned it calls itself; it does not. The ROM
 * table at 0x3104-0x310F is 0x3110/0x3110/0x311b/0x3126/0x3126/0x3131 (verified in the ROM
 * image by the MAPPING test below, which fingerprints the gate reached at every difficulty),
 * and all four gates are leaves. There is therefore no recursion to exercise; what the
 * dispatch actually needs exercised is EVERY difficulty byte — the whole table, both
 * duplicated slots, and the clamp — which the MAPPING and EXHAUSTIVE arms do at all 256
 * values, and the CRAFTED arm does on real captured entry states.
 *
 *   1. REACHABILITY + REAL CAPTURES + CRAFTED (realism) — 0x30fa IS on a live path
 *      (handler_1977 → 0x30ed → here): a 2000-frame attract run dispatches it 1197 times,
 *      the first at frame ~585. The live arm compares the candidate against the oracle at
 *      every one of those dispatches. A SECOND, shorter run (900 frames) then captures the
 *      first 24 real entry states, and each is re-run with DIFFICULTY poked identically on
 *      both sides over all six table slots and past the clamp — real states with a surgical
 *      nudge, since attract only ever presents difficulty 1 and would otherwise cover just
 *      one gate. Each replay compares RAM − STACK_SCRATCH and the returned decision on
 *      fresh clones.
 *
 *   2. EXHAUSTIVE — all 65536 (DIFFICULTY, FRAME) byte pairs against the oracle. The two
 *      bytes are the routine's entire input, so this is a proof rather than a sample.
 *
 *   3. MAPPING — the difficulty→gate table, re-derived from the oracle instead of trusted.
 *      Each gate has a distinct 256-frame decision fingerprint (1/2, 5/8, 3/4, 7/8 duty), so
 *      running the oracle over every frame value at a fixed difficulty identifies WHICH gate
 *      the ROM table sent it to. Done for all 256 difficulty bytes, and asserted against
 *      0/1→0x3110, 2→0x311b, 3/4→0x3126, ≥5→0x3131. The fingerprints are first asserted
 *      pairwise distinct, so the identification cannot be vacuous.
 *
 *   4. CALLER-SKIP SHAPE (live-out) — the returned boolean IS the oracle's two-level stack
 *      splice: the oracle consumes one stack word when it returns true and TWO when it
 *      returns false (measured here, both arms). That is the fact the idiomatic boolean
 *      stands for, and the fact the translated↔idiomatic seam needs when 0x30fa is wired
 *      live (it belongs in machine.js's SEAM_CALLER_SKIP at that point; it is deliberately
 *      absent while no idiomatic twin is registered).
 *
 *   5. TEETH — three broken twins, each caught by the exhaustive sweep, each a real way to
 *      get this dispatcher wrong: a clamp one short, a table without the ROM's duplicated
 *      slots, and a wrap instead of a clamp. The third is invisible to attract (it only
 *      differs at difficulty ≥6) — that is the point of sweeping all 256.
 *
 * Isolated runs use clone() (frame machinery neutralised: nextNmi/nextBoundary = Infinity)
 * so an m.step inside the oracle cannot trip a live NMI whose handler would write RAM and
 * masquerade as an oracle side effect, and park SP inside STACK_SCRATCH so the oracle's
 * table push and its ret/skip pops stay in dead RAM and never reach I/O space.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-30fa.test.js
