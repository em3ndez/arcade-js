/**
 * Memory-equivalence test for setUp75mBoard (ROM 0x0CF2) — the 75m (board 3, elevators)
 * board-setup arm. It stamps the elevator board's fixed tile motifs
 * (stamp75mBoardTiles, ROM 0x0D27), selects the 75m background tune (SND_BGM = 0x0A),
 * points DE at the 75m elevator layout table (ROM 0x3BE5), and runs the shared draw +
 * setup tail loc_0cc6 (ROM 0x0CC6).
 *
 * This is the CYCLE-FREE / memory-equivalence gate (docs/decompiler-pipeline), not the
 * retired strict whole-machine one. The arm WRITES memory through both callees and the
 * setup continuation carries state, so every case uses a FRESH clone per side and the
 * two are compared on the go-forward contract:
 *
 *     RAM (dumpState, minus STACK_SCRATCH) only.
 *
 * pc and SP are deliberately NOT compared: the oracle models its CALL/RET brackets with
 * push16/step/ret (return addresses left in the dead stack region), the plumbing the
 * direct-call layer replaces with a JS return. Those pushes land inside STACK_SCRATCH, so
 * they are masked by the contract. A/HL/B/DE and all flags are dead ABI: loc_0c92 (the
 * caller) reads no return value. DE is set only as a live-IN handed to the tail, not a
 * live-out of this arm.
 *
 * REACHABILITY. setUp75mBoard is 75m-only: loc_0c92 branches to it exactly when BOARD == 3.
 * Attract plays 25m, so it NEVER dispatches in a plain run. Following the sanctioned
 * "poke the board state to reach a state for validation", the test forces the real
 * dispatch with an IDENTICAL-BOTH-SIDES board-3 poke at frame 100 (GAME_STATE=3,
 * GAME_SUBSTATE=0x0A board-setup, SUBSTATE_TIMER=1, BOARD=3); loc_0c92 then m.call's
 * 0x0CF2 once (~frame 102) under the vblank NMI, giving a REAL captured entry (real
 * register file, real stack).
 *
 * Jobs:
 *   1. EQUAL (real forced dispatch) — oracle vs setUp75mBoard on fresh clones of the real
 *      board-3 entry leave identical RAM (−STACK_SCRATCH). Non-vacuous: the oracle side
 *      shows the whole chain ran — SND_BGM = 0x0A, the first elevator motif cell stamped
 *      (0x770D = 0xFD), and the setup continuation armed SUBSTATE_TIMER = 0x40. The dead
 *      stack traffic is proven load-bearing to the mask (stackDiffs > 0), and entry SP
 *      sits in STACK_SCRATCH so the exclusion is sound.
 *   2. TEETH (music) — a twin that writes the WRONG tune (0x09) MUST be caught at SND_BGM.
 *   3. TEETH (layout/DE) — a twin that points DE at the 25m table (0x3AE4) draws a
 *      DIFFERENT board; MUST be caught in the drawn tilemap. This proves the DE live-in
 *      marshalling is load-bearing.
 *   4. TEETH (stamp) — a twin that DROPS the elevator tile stamp MUST be caught at the
 *      motif cells.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-0cf2.test.js
