/**
 * Equivalence test for loc_0cc6 (ROM 0x0CC6) — the shared tail every board-setup arm
 * converges on: walk the DE-selected layout table (loc_0da7), stamp the eight rivet
 * cells on the 100m board only (stampRivetBoardTiles, guarded by BOARD == 4), then run
 * the board-setup prelude+continuation (loc_3fa0).
 *
 * loc_0cc6 WRITES memory through all three callees and the continuation carries state,
 * so it is gated by clone / replay with a FRESH clone per case. The memory-equivalence
 * contract is RAM − STACK_SCRATCH: the oracle's push/call/ret traffic lands in the dead
 * stack region, which the compare excludes; the direct-call layer drops it entirely.
 *
 * Attract builds 25m ONLY, so it dispatches 0x0CC6 with BOARD == 1 — the rivet gate
 * CLOSED, and the record walk covering every 25m segment. That one real entry validates
 * the glue on the gate-closed path; the gate-OPEN arm (BOARD 4) and the 50m/75m
 * continuation arms are reached by a Karl-sanctioned BOARD poke (2/3/4) applied
 * identically on both sides of the real entry.
 *
 *   1. STRUCTURE — real board-1 entry: game-visible RAM identical, and the oracle
 *      actually ran the continuation (SUBSTATE_TIMER armed to 0x40, GAME_SUBSTATE
 *      advanced). stackDiffs > 0 proves the exclusion is load-bearing; entry SP is in
 *      STACK_SCRATCH.
 *   2. BOARDS (crafted) — BOARD poked to 1/2/3/4 identically both sides: RAM − STACK
 *      identical per board, plus the observable rivet stamp on the oracle side when the
 *      gate opens (board 4: 0x76CA/0x76CB become 0xB8/0xB7).
 *   3. TEETH — four twins over loc_0cc6's three jobs and the rivet gate's BOTH
 *      directions: (a) skip the layout walk (caught in the drawn tilemap); (b) stamp
 *      the rivets UNCONDITIONALLY (caught on board 1, where the gate must stay closed);
 *      (c) skip the rivet stamp (caught on board 4, where the gate must fire); (d) skip
 *      the continuation (caught with the setup timer unarmed).
 *   4. REALISM — hook 0x0CC6 over a long attract run and replay every real dispatch;
 *      each RAM − STACK identical to the oracle.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-0cc6.test.js
