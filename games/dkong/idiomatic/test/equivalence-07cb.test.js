 * Equivalence test for loc_07cb (ROM 0x07cb) — the timed animation sub-state step.
 *
 * loc_07cb WRITES memory (the animation timer/pattern pair 0x638a/0x638b, tile-0xb0
 * fills across ~49 VRAM spans from the ROM table at 0x3d08, two queued tasks, the
 * reloaded 40-byte sprite-object block at 0x6908 + its two shifted columns, sub_3f24's
 * two VRAM bytes, and — on expiry — SUBSTATE_TIMER=2 + GAME_SUBSTATE++). It also drives
 * two WRITE-ONLY ls259 latch cells (0x7d86/0x7d87), which are NOT readable (a read
 * throws UnmappedAccess) and so are NOT part of dumpState() — the memory-equivalence
 * contract cannot see them via the RAM image. So it is validated two ways, each with
 * teeth, on a FRESH clone per case (a memory-writing routine demands it):
 *
 *   1. REALISM — hook 0x07cb in a real attract run (state-1 sub-state 6). It dispatches
 *      ~97x per attract cycle; the naturally-captured states span all three arms (arm =
 *      timer 0 at entry, tick = timer running, finish = the tick that lands on 0). For
 *      each real dispatch, run oracle vs loc_07cb on two fresh clones and confirm
 *      identical RAM (ex-stack) — this covers the fills, tasks, sprite block/columns,
 *      sub_3f24, the rotated-pattern save (0x638b), and the finish sub-state advance.
 *
 *   2. LATCH DECODE (write-trace) — because 0x7d86/0x7d87 are unreadable, capture the
 *      FINAL value written to each latch by hooking mem.write8, and compare oracle vs
 *      loc_07cb. Run over the real captures AND crafted pattern entries that drive all
 *      four (bit7,bit6) combinations, so the two-bit-per-frame decode is pinned.
 *
 *   3. CRAFTED — one start state per case, poked identically on both sides:
 *      (a) FINISH: timer 0x638a := 1 so the tick lands on 0 — pins SUBSTATE_TIMER=2 and
 *          the GAME_SUBSTATE increment on the finish arm.
 *      (b) PATTERN sweep: timer := 0x40 (a plain animation frame) with 0x638b swept over
 *          {0x00,0x40,0x80,0xc0,0x5f,0xff,0x3f} — pins the rotated-pattern save via RAM
 *          (0x638b IS in dumpState) and, together with test 2, the two latch bits.
 *
 *   4. TEETH — three deliberately-broken twins MUST be caught:
 *      (a) FINISH-ADVANCE twin (GAME_SUBSTATE += 2) — caught by the RAM diff at 0x600a.
 *      (b) FILL-TILE twin (stamps 0xb1) — caught by the RAM diff in the first VRAM span.
 *      (c) LATCH-BIT twin (0x7d87 fed bit 7 instead of bit 6) — caught by the write-trace
 *          on a pattern where bit7 != bit6; the RAM diff alone is blind to it.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-07cb.test.js
