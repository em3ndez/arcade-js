/**
 * Equivalence test for loc_1e10 (ROM 0x1E10) — the sub_1dbd effect-sprite setter that
 * loads the fixed pair (B=0x7F, DE=0x0008) and tail-jumps into the feeder loc_1e15.
 *
 * loc_1e10 WRITES memory only through its loc_1e15 chain (the task ring via enqueueTask,
 * the block[0] clear at *(0x6343), and — via the loc_1e36 tail — the sprite record
 * 0x6A30..0x6A33 + the gated sound 0x6085), so it is gated by capture / clone / replay
 * (docs/decompiler-pipeline) with a FRESH clone per case. Because the idiomatic loc_1e15 does NOT model
 * the Z80 stack while the oracle's `jp 0x1e15` chain does, the contract is RAM −
 * STACK_SCRATCH (never the full register file, never cycles), with the additional
 * requirement that idiomatic loc_1e10 leaves SP/pc UNCHANGED (it models no stack).
 *
 * loc_1e10's own body is branchless — it just sets two constants — and reads NEITHER B
 * NOR DE, so it depends on no entry register. The wrinkle is reachability: attract plays
 * level-1 25m only, and 0x1e10 is reached only when loc_1dc9 falls through at level >= 3
 * or loc_1df5 sees RNG 0x6018 bit1 set — neither happens in attract (measured: 0x1e10
 * dispatches 0x times over 8000 frames while its feeder 0x1e15 dispatches 6-8x). So the
 * gate is crafted-entry, built three ways:
 *
 *   1. REALISM / GENUINE ENTRY — force 0x1e10 down the real loc_1df5 path: at each real
 *      0x1df5 dispatch poke 0x6018 to 0x02 (bit0=0, bit1=1) identically, so loc_1df5's
 *      `jp c,0x1e10` fires and hands 0x1e10 a genuine, in-play machine state. Run the
 *      ORACLE on one clone and idiomatic loc_1e10 on another; every game-visible byte
 *      matches (residual confined to STACK_SCRATCH), and idiomatic leaves SP/pc put.
 *
 *   2. REALISM / BOUNDARY — real captured 0x1e15 dispatches (which attract DOES reach)
 *      are faithful loc_1e10 continuation states: loc_1e10 reads neither B nor DE, so
 *      the setter's identity that produced the capture is irrelevant — running loc_1e10
 *      on such a state is exactly "the level>=3 setter fired here." Same oracle-vs-
 *      idiomatic contract over many real states, breadth the single forced entry lacks.
 *
 *   3. BOARD (exhaustive crafted) — loc_1e36's sound gate is the chain's only board-
 *      dependent logic and attract only reaches 25m, so on a real base poke BOARD 0..255
 *      identically on both sides and compare. This pins the 50m/100m CLOSED arms
 *      (no 0x6085 write) attract never reaches; both gate arms are exercised.
 *
 *   4. TEETH — two twins the sweeps MUST catch: (a) wrong-B (0x7E) — loc_1e36 stores B
 *      unconditionally at record byte 0x6A31, so it diverges there on ANY base; (b)
 *      wrong-E (DE=0x0009) — enqueueTask writes E as the task's argument byte, so it
 *      diverges at the ring slot on a write-arm base.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-1e10.test.js
