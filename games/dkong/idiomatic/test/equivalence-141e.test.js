/**
 * Equivalence test for selectPlayerScreenOrAttract (ROM 0x141E) — the sub-state-0x14
 * handler that redraws the credit line, holds on the sub-state timer, then (on expiry)
 * blanks the screen, clears the two-byte player index, and scans the five 0x611C
 * player-context records to compose player 1's screen (record==1 -> 0x1459, A=1),
 * player 2's (record==3 -> 0x144f), or return to attract (neither -> 0x1475).
 *
 * loc_141e WRITES memory (the credit VRAM, the tilemap + sprite buffer, SUBSTATE_TIMER,
 * the player index 0x600D/0x600E, and — via the tail dispatches — GAME_SUBSTATE, the
 * flip latch, the task ring, GAME_STATE, ATTRACT) and has a data-dependent branch, so it
 * is validated by capture/clone/replay on a FRESH clone per case — never one shared
 * machine, never the full register file, never cycles. The compared contract is:
 *
 *   RAM (minus STACK_SCRATCH)  +  io.flipScreen (the 0x7D82 board latch)
 *
 * The flip latch is a board io output, NOT in the RAM dump; comparing io.flipScreen is
 * load-bearing because the tail arms drive it (attract sets 1; compose sets A|DIP). No
 * live-out registers/flags (the rst-0x28 NMI dispatch and every tail dispatch consume
 * none); SP/pc are not compared — the idiomatic layer drops the oracle's push/ret model.
 *
 * REACHABILITY. loc_141e is reached at game over (GAME_STATE 3, GAME_SUBSTATE 0x14). In a
 * 1-player coin+start game it dispatches exactly once, already at expiry (SUBSTATE_TIMER=1)
 * with all records zero — so the single natural dispatch takes the neither -> attract arm.
 * The other arms are forced from that real entry by identical-both-sides nudges (the doc-06
 * crafted-entry technique): raise SUBSTATE_TIMER for the timer-hold early-return, and force
 * expiry (SUBSTATE_TIMER=1) + poke one 0x611C record to 1 / 3 for the two compose arms.
 *
 *   1. REALISM (real dispatch) — capture every real loc_141e entry during the driven game
 *      and replay oracle vs candidate on fresh clones; RAM (ex-stack) + flip must be
 *      identical on each. Non-vacuous: assert the natural dispatch drove the oracle down the
 *      expiry -> attract arm (GAME_STATE 1 / ATTRACT 1).
 *
 *   2. CRAFTED (all four arms) — from the real entry, identical-both-sides nudges force each
 *      arm; oracle vs candidate must match and the oracle's own arm is asserted so no case
 *      passes vacuously: early-return (SUBSTATE_TIMER 5 -> stays GAME_STATE 3 / sub 0x14,
 *      timer decremented, nothing cleared); record==1 (composes -> sub 0x14->0x15, GAME_STATE
 *      stays 3); record==3 (also sets CURRENT_PLAYER=1); neither (attract -> GAME_STATE 1).
 *
 *   3. TEETH — three deliberately-broken twins the diff MUST catch: (a) skipping the
 *      player-index clear (RAM diff at 0x600D/0x600E, exposed by pre-dirtying them);
 *      (b) inverting the timer gate (runs the whole clear+scan on a NON-expiry frame the
 *      oracle early-returns from — a large RAM diff); (c) scanning for the wrong record
 *      value (2 not 1), so a crafted record==1 entry falls through to attract instead of
 *      composing (RAM diff at GAME_STATE / GAME_SUBSTATE).
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-141e.test.js
