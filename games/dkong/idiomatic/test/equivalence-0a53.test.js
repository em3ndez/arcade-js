 * Equivalence test for draw1UpLabel (ROM 0x0A53) — stamp player 1's "1UP" score
 * marker into three fixed video-RAM cells (0x7740 <- 0x01, 0x7720 <- 0x25,
 * 0x7700 <- 0x20).
 *
 * draw1UpLabel WRITES memory (three video-RAM cells) and is a subroutine reached
 * by `m.call` — not a pure leaf — so it is gated by capture / clone / replay
 * (docs/06), not the exhaustive-leaf pattern. It is input-independent and
 * straight-line (every value is an immediate, no data-dependent branch), so there
 * are NO unreached arms to craft; instead the crafted entries PRE-DIRTY the target
 * cells to prove the stamp is unconditional:
 *
 *   1. EQUAL (real captured dispatches) — hook 0x0A53 in a real attract run and
 *      clone the machine at each true dispatch (a FRESH clone per case, since the
 *      routine mutates video RAM). For each, run the ORACLE on one clone and
 *      draw1UpLabel on another and confirm they leave IDENTICAL RAM everywhere
 *      game-visible. The oracle's terminal `ret` only POPS (it writes no memory),
 *      so unlike a push-based routine there is not even stack-scratch residue —
 *      the two dumps are byte-identical. draw1UpLabel must also leave SP and pc
 *      unchanged (JS return replaces the modelled `ret`).
 *
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted pre-dirtied) — attract reaches this routine with the marker
 *      cells already blank/valid, so to prove the stamp is UNCONDITIONAL the
 *      crafted entries poke the three target cells (and their neighbours) to
 *      garbage, IDENTICALLY on both sides, then confirm oracle == draw1UpLabel and
 *      that the three cells end at exactly 0x01 / 0x25 / 0x20.
 *
 *   3. TEETH — a deliberately-broken twin that stamps a wrong value into one of the
 *      routine's own cells (0x7740) MUST be caught by the captured sweep, naming
 *      0x7740. A gate a real corruption slips through is worthless.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-0a53.test.js
