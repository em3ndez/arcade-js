/**
 * Memory-equivalence test for stamp75mBoardTiles (ROM 0x0D27) — "stamp two fixed
 * two-row tile motifs into the background tilemap" during 75m (board 3, elevator)
 * setup. It calls fillTileRowPair (ROM 0x0D30) twice, at HL = 0x770D then 0x760D,
 * laying 68 background-tilemap bytes: 17×0xFD then 17×0xFC below it, for each of the
 * two motifs.
 *
 * This is the CYCLE-FREE / memory-equivalence gate (docs/decompiler-pipeline), not the retired strict
 * whole-machine one. The routine WRITES video RAM (via its callee), so every case uses
 * a FRESH clone per side. The oracle runs on one clone, stamp75mBoardTiles on another,
 * and they are compared on the go-forward contract:
 *
 *     RAM (dumpState, minus STACK_SCRATCH) only.
 *
 * pc and SP are deliberately NOT compared: the oracle models the CALL/RET with
 * push16/step/ret (pc→target, SP moved, the return address left in the dead stack), the
 * plumbing the direct-call layer replaces with a JS return. The oracle's push of its
 * return address lands inside STACK_SCRATCH (measured: entry SP = 0x6BEC → write at
 * 0x6BEA/0x6BEB), so it is masked by the contract. HL/DE/B/A and all flags are dead ABI
 * (loc_0cf2 reloads A and DE after the call and never reads HL), so they are neither
 * reproduced nor compared; the whole-machine RAM gate backstops that.
 *
 * REACHABILITY. stamp75mBoardTiles is 75m-only: the elevator-board setup arm loc_0cf2
 * (BOARD(0x6227)==3) is its sole caller (loc_0cd4 only mentions 0x0D27 in a comment).
 * Attract plays 25m, so it NEVER dispatches in a plain run. Following the sanctioned
 * "poke the board state to reach a state for validation", the test forces the real
 * dispatch with an IDENTICAL-BOTH-SIDES board-3 poke at frame 100 (GAME_STATE=3,
 * GAME_SUBSTATE=0x0A board-setup, SUBSTATE_TIMER=1, BOARD=3); loc_0cf2 then runs under
 * the vblank NMI and calls 0x0D27 once (~frame 102), giving a REAL captured entry (real
 * register file, real stack, real garbage HL that the routine ignores).
 *
 * Jobs:
 *   1. EQUAL (real forced dispatch) — oracle vs stamp75mBoardTiles on fresh clones of
 *      the real board-3 entry leave identical RAM (−STACK_SCRATCH).
 *   2. WRITE-SET (captured) — over pre-dirtied destinations, the oracle's only NON-stack
 *      writes are the 68 bytes: 0xFD/0xFC at the two motifs from 0x770D and 0x760D.
 *   3. CRAFTED (fresh-boot + garbage entry) — the routine takes NO input, so instead of
 *      varying an input we prove input-independence: run it on a synthetic fresh-boot
 *      machine that never saw the board-3 poke, and on the captured entry with garbage
 *      registers + far RAM; both stamp the same motif and RAM stays identical.
 *   4. TEETH — (a) a twin that writes a WRONG tile (0xFF) to the first cell (0x770D) and
 *      (b) a twin that OMITS the second motif (0x760D) MUST both be caught, naming the
 *      offending cell.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-0d27.test.js
