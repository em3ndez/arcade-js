 * Equivalence test for settleFireOnGirderSlope (ROM 0x33C3) — on 25m, re-step one object-record
 * coordinate through the girder-slope single-step (snapYToGirder) and store it back into
 * record field +0x0F; on any other board, do nothing.
 *
 * 0x33C3 is NOT wired into the live dispatcher (its callers 0x32AB and the fall-through
 * from 0x33AD are still frozen oracles), so there are NO natural attract dispatches to
 * capture — the whole gate is CRAFTED on a real attract-base machine, identically poked on
 * both sides. The routine dissolves the oracle's push16/call/ret bracket (snapYToGirder is a
 * pure JS function), so it models no stack; runCandidate performs ONE m.ret() after it to
 * line pc + SP up with the oracle, and the RAM diff EXCLUDES the dead STACK_SCRATCH the
 * oracle's push16 churn writes (the memory-equivalence contract, mirroring
 * equivalence-0350.test.js).
 *
 *   1. EQUAL (board guard) — every non-25m selector early-outs with no non-stack RAM
 *      write, matching the oracle's `cp 1 / ret nz`; the crafted fields WOULD step if the
 *      guard were missing, so the no-write is genuine.
 *   2. EQUAL (25m step sweep) — a matrix of (companion, coord, state) that exercises every
 *      snapYToGirder arm (hold vs step, both sentinel coordinates 240/76, both slope directions,
 *      both travel directions). Each asserts identical contract (RAM − STACK_SCRATCH, pc,
 *      SP) AND that the stored +0x0F equals snapYToGirder(companion, coord, state) — proving the
 *      wrapper actually passes the coordinates through and stores the result. Non-vacuity:
 *      the sweep is required to contain both cases that changed the coordinate and cases
 *      that held it.
 *   3. TEETH — two broken twins, each MUST be caught:
 *      (a) dropped board guard (always steps) — caught on a non-25m case where the step
 *          changes the coordinate.
 *      (b) swapped snapYToGirder coordinates (companion<->coord) — caught on a 25m case where
 *          the two argument orders give different results.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT, cross-file and therefore recorded here rather than in the routine: memory-only — the
 * single stored coordinate at record +0x0F. The oracle's residual registers and flags and its
 * terminal return are dead ABI; the board-guard early-out replaces its `ret nz`.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-33c3.test.js
