// idiomatic — the Donkey Kong go-live gates. Tests 1 and 2 run the ASSEMBLED game under the cycle-free
// coroutine engine (core/frame-stepped.js runIdiomaticGame) and compare it against the pure-
// translated oracle under runCycleFree, both crossing vblank at the wait at ROM 0x02BD. Test 3 is a
// structural check on the Machine; test 4 runs only the oracle. ROM-guarded.
//
//   1. "the idiomatic spine reproduces the translated oracle" — the override MAP holds only the boot
//      generator at 0x0000; the layer's direct imports run as JS and the engine fires the idiomatic
//      vblank handler directly (idiomaticNmi). 600 attract frames vs the oracle.
//
//   2. "the FULL FLIP" — resolveAllIdiomatic(), the configuration web/worker.js ships. Asserts SP is
//      INERT (runbook §4, "Retiring SP"): it never moves from its power-on value on any sample and
//      the direct-call NMI never touches it. Nothing resets SP any more, so a stray push/pop anywhere
//      in the frame shows as a persistent move (the old per-frame epilogue reset that absorbed
//      in-NMI deltas is gone). Also asserts the run reaches its budget and reproduces the oracle on
//      every live cell.
//
//   3. "with no overrides the seam is not installed at all" — an empty override map carries no own
//      push16/pop16/call, so every oracle run (incl. `runOracle` here) is the untouched prototype
//      path. Says nothing about the shipped player (test 2). Carries its own teeth.
//
//   4. "the seam's stack-effect tables still match the frozen oracle" — re-derives SEAM_CALLER_SKIP /
//      SEAM_TAIL_NO_RET from an instrumented attract run; entries attract never reaches are not
//      checked, and the count is reported.
//
// CONTRACT: byte-for-byte on every LIVE cell (work, sprite and video RAM), excluding only the dead
// stack scratch [0x6BE0, 0x6C00), which the idiomatic side never writes (test 2 proves SP inert).
// SCOPE: the ATTRACT sequence only; gameplay live-cell parity is NOT asserted here.
