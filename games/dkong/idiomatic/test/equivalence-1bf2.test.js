/**
 * Equivalence test for loc_1bf2 (ROM 0x1BF2) — the airborne handler's leftward-nudge arm.
 *
 * loc_1bf2 is entered by a tail branch from the airborne handler advanceMarioAirborneFrame, carrying the
 * position gate's LEFT verdict in the register bank (both the frozen ROM 0x1BB2 oracle this
 * suite replays against and the idiomatic advanceMarioAirborneFrame hand it over that way):
 *
 *   verdict not raised -> hand straight on to the airborne dispatch 0x1C05, changing nothing
 *   verdict raised     -> MARIO_AIR_VX := 0xFF80 (half a pixel per frame leftward),
 *                         clear MARIO_SPRITE_CODE's facing bit, then the 0x1BD8 tail
 *
 * The 0x1BD8 tail is direct-called (it has an idiomatic file); the 0x1C05 tail is still the
 * frozen oracle and stays a registry call. Either way the whole chain below runs on BOTH sides
 * of every comparison here, so a wrong hand-off surfaces as divergent RAM downstream rather
 * than staying local.
 *
 * MEMORY-EQUIVALENCE CONTRACT. RAM − STACK_SCRATCH [0x6be0,0x6c00), plus pc, SP and the
 * forwarded return value (the airborne cascade above uses it for the caller-skip convention);
 * live-out is otherwise memory-only. WHY no register or flag is compared: the verdict register
 * and the flags of the oracle's decrement are dead past the branch — on BOTH tails the next
 * routine to look at that register pair is the tile classifier at 0x2B9B, whose `pop de`
 * overwrites the pair outright, and every flag consumer downstream (0x1BDC, 0x2B2D) sets the
 * flags itself first. No pose or velocity value survives in a register either; everything the
 * routine decides is written to RAM. The direct call to reverseMarioVerticalArc dissolves the oracle's
 * push/pop bracket around its fixed-point leaf, which is what the exclusion is for — but in
 * fact the stack matches too, and that finding is asserted separately at the end of suite 3
 * rather than folded into the contract.
 *
 *   1. REALISM (captured) — hook 0x1BF2 in a real attract run: 360 dispatches, of which a
 *      120-dispatch sample is replayed in full. All 360 take the NOT-raised arm (checked on
 *      every dispatch, not just the sample): plain attract never gets Mario airborne past the
 *      gate's right-hand limit, so the raised arm is genuinely unreached there. The same tally
 *      pins the other fact the routine's header leans on — the context-block base register is
 *      Mario's block on every one of the 360.
 *
 *   2. REALISM (captured under a control poke) — the raised arm is NOT dead code, and it is
 *      not covered by fabrication: holding MARIO_X past the gate's right-hand limit in an
 *      otherwise untouched attract run makes the REAL ROM take the raised arm 2713 times.
 *      Those real dispatches are captured and replayed as their own suite.
 *
 *   3. EXHAUSTIVE (crafted from real bases) — the verdict register is the routine's only
 *      decision input, so it is swept over ALL 256 values from a real captured base, crossed
 *      with the facing bit set/clear (the poked run only ever presents it clear, so the
 *      bit-CLEAR semantics are only observable here) and with MARIO_FATAL_FALL 0/1 so both of
 *      the 0x1BD8 tail's own arms run. 1024 cases, identical on both sides.
 *
 *   4. TEETH — five broken twins, each MUST be caught:
 *      (a) inverted verdict test        — nudges when it should skip.
 *      (b) any-nonzero verdict test     — invisible to attract (verdict is always 0 there);
 *                                         ONLY the exhaustive sweep catches it.
 *      (c) wrong drift sign (0x0080)    — caught at MARIO_X: the tail's integrator applies the
 *                                         stamped velocity on the same frame, so a flipped
 *                                         sign moves Mario the wrong way immediately.
 *      (d) dropped facing-bit clear     — invisible unless the bit was set, so ONLY the
 *                                         crafted facing-set cases catch it.
 *      (e) wrong tail (0x1C05 on the raised arm) — skips the arc re-base.
 *
 *      Each twin is otherwise byte-for-byte the real routine, tail included, so the one
 *      difference under test is the only difference there is.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-1bf2.test.js
