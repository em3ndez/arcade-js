/**
 * Equivalence test for loc_1e96 (ROM 0x1E96) — the router for the effect-sequence step machine
 * held in EFFECT_SEQ_STATE (0x6345). It reads that step byte and hands the frame to one of three
 * handlers: step 0 -> buildEffectSprite (build the sprite + cue the sound), step 1 ->
 * flashEffectSpriteThenAdvanceSequence (flash the tile), step 2 ->
 * animateEffectSpriteThenRearmEffect (march the tile, then tear down and re-arm).
 *
 * loc_1e96 writes no memory itself; every visible byte is the chosen handler's. Its return value
 * is undefined on every path on both sides (all three handlers return nothing, and the caller
 * loc_1e8c discards the result and takes its own skip decision), so the return is asserted
 * directly and no register or flag is a live-out. SP/pc are the dropped stack model — the
 * oracle walks the jump table through the stack and returns through its own chain, all inside
 * STACK_SCRATCH. The contract is therefore memory-equivalence on RAM - STACK_SCRATCH plus the
 * return value, on a FRESH clone per case (the handlers write memory and cue sounds):
 *
 *   1. REALISM — the routine is REACHABLE NATURALLY: hook 0x1E96 in a plain attract run (no
 *      pokes, no coin) and clone at each real dispatch. 4000 frames yield 438 of them spanning
 *      every reachable step (6 at step 0, 180 at step 1, 252 at step 2). Each is replayed
 *      oracle-vs-idiomatic on independent fresh clones; every game-visible byte and the return
 *      value must match. The oracle's entry SP is asserted to sit inside STACK_SCRATCH so
 *      excluding that region cannot mask a real diff.
 *
 *   2. EXHAUSTIVE (step sweep) — poke EFFECT_SEQ_STATE to all 256 values identically on both
 *      sides of a real base. This covers the three live steps, the three +128 aliases the
 *      oracle's eight-bit slot arithmetic produces (128/129/130 select steps 0/1/2), and the
 *      250 states that run off the three-entry table — where both sides must throw AND leave
 *      identical game-visible RAM. The sweep asserts the observed shape too: exactly
 *      {0,1,2,128,129,130} dispatch, everything else refuses.
 *
 *   3. TEETH — three deliberately-broken twins, each caught at a named cell:
 *      (a) the step-0 one-shot dropped to a no-op — caught on a real step-0 entry, and named:
 *          the sequence never advances (EFFECT_SEQ_STATE stays 0) and the effect's priority
 *          sound is never cued (SND_PRIORITY).
 *      (b) steps 1 and 2 swapped — caught on a real BEAT entry (the divider is at 1, so the
 *          two handlers reload EFFECT_SEQ_INNER to different values), named at 0x6346.
 *      (c) the +128 alias selection dropped (raw step index instead of the low seven bits) —
 *          caught by the exhaustive sweep at state 128, where the oracle dispatches step 0 and
 *          the twin refuses. This is what proves the sweep's alias coverage is not decorative.
