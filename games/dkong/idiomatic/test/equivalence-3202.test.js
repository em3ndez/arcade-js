 * Equivalence test for loc_3202 (ROM 0x3202) — service one record of the 0x6400 object array:
 * route it through the state machine its state selects, then publish its working position into
 * the drawn OBJ_X/OBJ_Y.
 *
 * WHAT THIS GATE ACTUALLY COVERS, stated before the tests so a green run is not over-read:
 *
 *   • ATTRACT ONLY. Every real dispatch replayed here comes from the boot+attract sequence.
 *     0x3202 is first dispatched at frame 870 and fires 481 times in 3000 frames. No gameplay
 *     board is covered, on either side.
 *   • Attract produces 16 distinct entry shapes (record base x insert-requested x OBJ_STATE x
 *     the +0x19 field x the RANDOM low-bit gate) — all of them on record base 0x6400, with
 *     OBJ_STATE only ever 0, 1 or 8 and the +0x19 field always 0. Sampled per the batch policy:
 *     every 20th capture PLUS the first capture at each distinct shape; test 1 asserts the
 *     sample covers every shape the run saw, and prints how many of how many were replayed.
 *   • Attract NEVER reaches three arms, measured across 3000 attract frames by counting callee
 *     dispatches inside 0x3202: the +0x19 timer branch (loc_32d6, 0 of 481 dispatches), the
 *     out-of-band reverse at ROM 0x3297 (0 of 481 — loc_33c3 fires exactly as often as loc_33ad,
 *     i.e. only as its fall-through tail), and the HIGH working-X edge (0 of 481; the LOW edge
 *     does fire, on 2). Those, plus the OBJ_STATE values attract never shows (2, 3, 4, 131, 132,
 *     255), are CRAFTED on a real captured dispatch and poked identically on both sides. The
 *     insert-requested arm (32 of 481) and the table-index reload (57 of 481) ARE covered by
 *     real captures, and are crafted as well.
 *
 * THE COMPARED CONTRACT is RAM minus the dead STACK_SCRATCH, plus the return value. pc and SP
 * are NOT compared: the idiomatic routine replaces the Z80 stack with the JS call stack and
 * emits no per-instruction pc, so neither can be preserved. The oracle's push16/ret churn is
 * exactly what the STACK_SCRATCH exclusion covers, and test 4 proves that exclusion is not
 * hiding a live cell.
 *
 * ORACLE BOUNDARY: the movement/collision state machine at ROM 0x333D has no idiomatic twin in
 * ROUTINES yet, so both sides reach it through the registry and run the identical subtree.
 *
 *   1. REACHABILITY + EQUAL (captured) — hook 0x3202 in a real attract run, clone at the
 *      sampled dispatches, and confirm loc_3202 == oracle on every one.
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted) — the arms attract cannot supply, on a real captured base.
 *   3. ARM COVERAGE — assert, by counting callee dispatches on the oracle side, that the
 *      captured + crafted corpus together fire every arm this routine has.
 *   4. EXCLUSION IS EXACT — without the stack exclusion the only diffs lie inside STACK_SCRATCH.
 *   5. TEETH — five deliberately-broken twins the corpus MUST catch.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-3202.test.js
