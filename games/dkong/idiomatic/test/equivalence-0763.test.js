/**
 * Memory-equivalence test for loc_0763 (ROM 0x0763) — the timed game-state-1
 * sub-state reset: on the pass where both halves of the sub-state timer expire, clear the
 * object-insert request (0x63A0) + a paired engine-scratch byte (0x6392), reseed the live
 * context to board 1 / level 1 / one life (0x6227/0x6229/0x6228), then tail into the board
 * builder (buildBoard, ROM 0x0C92). Until the timer expires the pass only ticks it.
 *
 * This is the CYCLE-FREE / memory-equivalence gate (docs/decompiler-pipeline). The routine
 * writes memory through its callees (the two-level timer tick and the whole board build) and
 * the reset carries state, so every case uses a FRESH clone per side and the two are compared
 * on the go-forward contract:
 *
 *     RAM (dumpState) minus STACK_SCRATCH.
 *
 * pc and SP are deliberately NOT compared. The oracle models its control flow with the Z80
 * stack: the `rst 0x20` gate does a caller-skip (a double return) on the not-yet-expired
 * path, and the `jp 0x0c92` is a tail-jump whose callee's `ret` returns on this routine's
 * behalf — plus the board builder's own deep call/ret brackets. Every one of those pushes
 * lands inside STACK_SCRATCH, so they are masked by the contract; the direct-call idiomatic
 * layer replaces them with the JS call stack and a boolean early-return. Registers/flags are
 * dead ABI (the dispatcher reads no return value).
 *
 * REACHABILITY. 0x0763 is dispatched on every game-state-1 sub-state pass, so a plain attract
 * run mints hundreds of real dispatches spanning BOTH skip sub-cases (the fast prescaler still
 * counting; the fast prescaler expired but the sub-state counter still counting) AND — a couple
 * of times per attract cycle — the reset+build path where both expire together. Those real
 * captures are the primary gate; crafted entries then preset the object-insert request nonzero
 * so its clear is observable and force the reset path deterministically.
 *
 * Jobs:
 *   1. REACHABILITY — a plain attract run dispatches 0x0763, capturing skip and run entries.
 *   2. EQUAL (captured) — loc_0763 == oracle over RAM − STACK_SCRATCH on every real
 *      dispatch; non-vacuous (the run entries genuinely build a board; the mask is load-bearing).
 *   3. EQUAL (crafted) — a run entry with the object-insert request + level preset nonzero
 *      matches the oracle (proving the reseed reproduces), plus a forced skip and a forced run.
 *   4. TEETH — three broken twins, each MUST be caught:
 *        (a) wrong life count (LIVES = 2) — caught at LIVES (0x6228).
 *        (b) dropped level reseed (LEVEL left at its preset) — caught at LEVEL (0x6229). (The
 *            0x6392 / 0x63A0 clears are faithful but redundant — the 25m setup arm re-clears
 *            both — so a load-bearing reseed cell is used for teeth instead.)
 *        (c) gate NOT enforced (body runs on a skip frame) — caught (board build leaks out).
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-0763.test.js
