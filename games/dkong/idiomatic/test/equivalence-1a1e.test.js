 * Equivalence test for bonusExpiredIdle (ROM 0x1a1e) — the idle (do-nothing) arm of
 * the bonus-expired state machine. entry_1a07 (ROM 0x1A07) dispatches an rst-0x28
 * router on BONUS_EXPIRED_STEP (0x6386, values 0..3); idx0 -> 0x1A1E is a single-byte
 * `ret`. It reads and writes NO memory and leaves NO live registers (entry_1a07 ->
 * loc_197a @0x19BF reads nothing on return, it just proceeds to the next call 0x2FCB),
 * so live-out is memory-only — in fact empty. It is gated on memory-equivalence over
 * RAM (minus STACK_SCRATCH) + pc + SP, and every case runs on a FRESH clone:
 *
 *   1. EQUAL (real captured dispatches) — hook 0x1a1e in a real attract run and clone
 *      the machine at each true dispatch. Attract reaches it ~1197 times over 2000
 *      frames from entry_1a07 while BONUS_EXPIRED_STEP == 0 (entry SP 0x6bea-0x6bee,
 *      all inside STACK_SCRATCH). For each capture: (a) confirm the ORACLE itself writes
 *      NO RAM (the "does nothing" claim, direct), and (b) confirm bonusExpiredIdle ==
 *      oracle on RAM-STACK_SCRATCH + pc + SP.
 *
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted entry) — the routine is branchless, so there are no unreached
 *      ARMS; instead the craft exercises a state the natural run never produces: SP
 *      pointed into ordinary work RAM (0x6100) with a return address staged there, so
 *      the popped bytes land in the COMPARED region rather than the dead stack. This
 *      proves the `ret`'s pop is READ-ONLY even there (no clobber of the return slot),
 *      identically both sides.
 *
 *   3. TEETH — two deliberately-broken twins, each MUST be caught:
 *      (a) a stray-write twin (advances BONUS_EXPIRED_STEP to 2, i.e. does the INIT
 *          arm's "advance the step" work by mistake) — caught by the RAM diff on
 *          every case;
 *      (b) an extra-stack-pop twin (a leaked stack-pop the idiomatic routine must NOT
 *          do) — caught by the SP (and usually pc) diff on every case.
 *
 * The idiomatic routine models the Z80 `ret` as a JS return (no stack modelling), so
 * the harness performs one m.ret() on the candidate clone AFTER the call to line pc +
 * SP up with the oracle (which rets internally). The oracle only READS the stack (the
 * ret pop), never writes it, so RAM is byte-equal on both sides regardless.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-1a1e.test.js
