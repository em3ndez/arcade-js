/**
 * Memory-equivalence gate for loc_1ff6 (ROM 0x1FF6) — the shared tail of the 25m object sweep's
 * two horizontal-step arms.
 *
 * WHAT EACH CASE ACTUALLY COVERS. Read this before trusting a green run.
 *
 *  1. CAPTURED — EVERY real dispatch, no sampling. A hook at 0x1FF6 runs a 3000-frame attract
 *     run; at each dispatch the machine is REHOSTED into two fresh override-free machines and the
 *     oracle and the rewrite are run one on each, with every frozen continuation running for real
 *     on both sides. 4742 dispatches, 7 record bases, four of the routine's five arms. Rehosting
 *     rather than cloning is load-bearing twice over: this routine's own tail chain re-enters it,
 *     so a clone (which carries the override map) would re-enter the hook during the replay and
 *     grow the capture list underneath the loop — and the fresh machine is what makes replaying
 *     all 4742 cost half a second instead of needing a sample.
 *
 *  2. CRAFTED — the fifth arm, which attract NEVER takes (0 of 4742): the bounds gate at
 *     ROM 0x24B4 discarding this routine's return address and carrying the sweep on itself. The
 *     entries are built by poking two record bytes on a REAL capture, so the stack, the shadow
 *     bank and the loop state are all genuine. Which arm an entry reaches is read off the ORACLE's
 *     own 0x24B4 return value, never off the rewrite, so the coverage claim is not circular.
 *
 *  3. TEETH — five broken twins, and the case records which of (1) and (2) caught each. One of
 *     them is reachable ONLY through the crafted arm, which is why (2) exists.
 *
 *  4. LIVE — the whole machine, cycle-free. The rewrite is wired at 0x1FF6 for a 6000-frame
 *     attract run and every frame's live state is compared against a baseline that differs in
 *     NOTHING ELSE: both machines wire the two already-idiomatic callees (ROM 0x2333 and 0x23DE)
 *     at their addresses, so the only variable is 0x1FF6 itself. Running both sides under
 *     core/frame-stepped.js `runCycleFree` puts the vblank NMI on a control-flow boundary rather
 *     than a cycle count, so the rewrite being cycle-free costs nothing and no cycle charge has to
 *     be restored. The dispatch count is asserted non-zero and printed — without that this case
 *     can pass while never running the routine at all.
 *
 *  5. LIVE-OUT — the same run with the ORACLE at 0x1FF6 and exactly the registers the rewrite
 *     DROPS scrambled at the moment control leaves it, hand-off by hand-off. Poisoning at the seam
 *     rather than after the dispatch is the point: by the time the frozen chain has returned, it
 *     has redefined everything and the probe would be aimed at the wrong boundary. Carries its own
 *     non-vacuity check — the same poison aimed at the registers the rewrite KEEPS must diverge.
 *
 * CONTRACT COMPARED in (1) and (2): the work/sprite/video state dump minus STACK_SCRATCH, the
 * forwarded return value, and — as extras beyond the required contract — pc and SP. STACK_SCRATCH
 * is excluded because this rewrite dissolves the oracle's brackets around ROM 0x2333 and ROM
 * 0x23DE (both callees are idiomatic and direct-called) while keeping the one around ROM 0x24B4,
 * so the stack bytes legitimately differ; pc and SP are compared because they legitimately hold —
 * every continuation is still frozen and maintains both for either side — and they are the only
 * thing that catches a dropped call bracket, which lands entirely inside the excluded region.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-1ff6.test.js
