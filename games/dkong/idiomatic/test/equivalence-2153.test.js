/**
 * Equivalence test for loc_2153 (ROM 0x2153) — store one value into three fields of the object
 * record the caller left in the index register (the elapsed-frame counter at +20 and the two
 * fractional coordinate halves at +4 and +6), then jump to the shared object-sprite tail at
 * ROM 0x21BA, which is still the frozen oracle on BOTH sides here and is therefore not under
 * test. What this gate has to prove is the three writes, that they carry the value the caller
 * supplied rather than a hard-coded zero, and that the tail's result is handed back.
 *
 *   0. REACHABILITY — how many real 0x2153 dispatches a 6000-frame attract run produces, and
 *      which of the two frozen callers each came through (the caller identity is MEASURED, by
 *      hooking ROM 0x2118 and ROM 0x2146 in the same run, not inferred from the entry state).
 *
 *   1. EQUAL (captured) — ALL captured dispatches are replayed, not a sample: the run produces
 *      13, which is far below the point where sampling is worth its coverage risk. Each is
 *      replayed on two byte-identical clones — oracle on one, loc_2153 on the other — and
 *      compared on RAM − STACK_SCRATCH plus the RETURN VALUE. pc/SP are deliberately not
 *      compared: cycle-free code cannot preserve them.
 *
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted) — attract stores 0 on every one of the 13 dispatches, so the captured
 *      arm cannot tell the parameter from a hard-coded zero. All 256 stored values are swept on
 *      a REAL captured entry, one per distinct entry shape the run produced, poked identically
 *      on both sides. Non-vacuity is asserted: the swept value must actually reach all three
 *      record fields.
 *
 *   3. LIVE-WIRE — loc_2153 drives a whole 2000-frame attract run as a registered override and
 *      every frame of the state trace must match the all-oracle baseline. THE CYCLE RESTORATION
 *      IS NOT COSMETIC: Donkey Kong seeds its RNG from timing (SPIN_COUNT counts main-loop
 *      passes per frame), so a rewrite that charges no T-states reseeds the PRNG and the run
 *      forks for reasons that have nothing to do with the rewrite. The harness measures what the
 *      oracle would have spent on each dispatch — by running it on a throwaway clone — and
 *      charges exactly that. The CONTROL test below wires the same rewrite WITHOUT the
 *      restoration and asserts the trace does fork, which is what shows this arm is sensitive
 *      rather than lenient. The contract asserted is RAM − STACK_SCRATCH, the same as arm 1;
 *      the full dump INCLUDING the stack region is asserted as well, and holds here because
 *      this rewrite has no stack traffic of its own to lose (its only stack effect is the
 *      frozen tail's, which it still reaches through that same frozen tail).
 *
 *   4. TEETH — four broken twins, each of which some arm above MUST catch:
 *        (a) hard-zero          — writes 0 instead of the supplied value. INVISIBLE to arm 1
 *                                 (attract always supplies 0); caught only by arm 2's sweep.
 *        (b) coordinate clobber — writes the Y integer (+5) where its fraction (+6) belongs.
 *        (c) no counter clear   — drops the +20 write.
 *        (d) returns false      — identical RAM, wrong result. INVISIBLE to the RAM diff;
 *                                 caught only by the return assertion. Not a hypothetical: a
 *                                 `false` from an address that is not in machine.js's
 *                                 SEAM_CALLER_SKIP makes the seam consume a stack word the
 *                                 routine does not owe.
 *
 * COVERAGE THIS DOES NOT CLAIM: attract only, plus pokes on top of attract state. No credited
 * game, no board other than 25m, and no OBJ_ARRAY_67 record past the second — attract reaches
 * none of those. The RETURN assertion is real but has never been observed distinguishing a
 * REACHED state: the frozen tail returns undefined on every state this run produces, so twin
 * (d) is what gives that assertion its teeth, not the captures.
 *
 * Isolated replays use clone(), whose frame machinery is neutralised (nextNmi / nextBoundary =
 * Infinity), so an m.step inside the oracle cannot trip a live NMI whose handler would write RAM
 * and masquerade as an oracle side effect.
 *
 * The two callers are hooked with their own FROZEN oracles, delegating unchanged — they are a
 * label on each capture, not a substitution, so the capture run is the oracle's own run. Both
 * are still frozen, which is also why loc_2153 reaches its tail through the address registry.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-2153.test.js
