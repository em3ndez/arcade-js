 * Equivalence test for clearScreenAndAdvanceSubstate (ROM 0x07c3) — the attract
 * state-1 sub-state step that CLEARS the screen (call 0x0874) then INCREMENTS the
 * sub-state index at GAME_SUBSTATE (0x600A).
 *
 * loc_07c3 WRITES memory (the clear regions of 0x0874 — video RAM 0x7404.. + the
 * 0x7522/0x7523 columns + sprite buffer 0x6900-0x6A7F — plus a `+1` RMW on 0x600A)
 * and reads NOTHING register-wise: every operand is an immediate or the fixed
 * 0x600A byte. So it is validated by capture/clone/replay on a FRESH clone per case
 * — never by reusing one machine, never on the full register file, never on cycles.
 * The contract compared is RAM (minus STACK_SCRATCH); there are no live-out
 * registers (the `inc (hl)` leaves Z/S/A dead — the rst-0x28 sub-state dispatch
 * returns up the NMI path, which consumes none of them). SP/PC are not compared —
 * the idiomatic layer drops the `ret`'s stack/PC bookkeeping (JS call stack).
 *
 *   1. REALISM — hook 0x07c3 in a real attract run; it dispatches once (state-1
 *      sub-state 5) inside a ~3000-frame window. For each real dispatch, run oracle
 *      vs clearScreenAndAdvanceSubstate on two fresh clones and confirm identical
 *      RAM (ex-stack) — this exercises both the clear and the real 0x600A inc.
 *
 *   2. CRAFTED (footprint + inc-wrap) — because the routine reads nothing, one start
 *      state per case with the clear regions painted to a SENTINEL (distinct from
 *      the fill bytes 0x10 / 0x00) and 0x600A poked across a value sweep INCLUDING
 *      the 8-bit wrap edge 0xFF->0x00, identically on both sides, pins BOTH the exact
 *      clear footprint AND that the inc lands on 0x600A with byte wrap. Any stray or
 *      missing write shows sentinel-vs-fill (regions) or a lone 0x600A diff (inc), so
 *      the RAM gate bites.
 *
 *   3. TEETH — two deliberately-broken twins MUST be caught: (a) a DOUBLE-INCREMENT
 *      of 0x600A (wrong sub-state advance) — caught by the 0x600A byte on every
 *      entry; and (b) a SKIP-CLEAR (advance only, screen not blanked) — caught on the
 *      sentinel entry, where the un-cleared regions hold the sentinel vs the oracle's
 *      fill bytes.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-07c3.test.js
