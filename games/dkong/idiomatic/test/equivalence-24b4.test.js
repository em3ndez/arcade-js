/**
 * retireBarrelIntoOilDrum — memory-equivalent to the frozen oracle at ROM 0x24B4 — the
 * object-retirement gate: an object whose OBJ_Y has reached 232 with its OBJ_X inside the 32..41
 * band is retired (slot freed, column blanked, impact sound asserted, two mode latches armed) and
 * handed to the shared object-sprite tail WITHOUT returning to the caller; anything else returns
 * untouched. ATTRACT ONLY — credited play and boards 2-4 are NOT covered (this walk runs on 25m).
 *
 * What this gate covers:
 *   1. EQUAL (captured): a 1200-frame attract run dispatches 0x24B4 1154 times (first at frame 613)
 *      across five OBJ_ARRAY_67 record bases. EVERY dispatch is replayed inline — no sampling, which
 *      is load-bearing: attract's entire coverage of the band's high edge (one OBJ_X == 42) and of
 *      the retirement arm is one dispatch each, and two twins are caught by exactly those. Each
 *      replay isolates ONE dispatch (candidate called on a fresh override-free machine; re-entries
 *      run the ORACLE on both sides).
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted): five arms for what attract cannot produce, each ONE poke on a real capture,
 *      each proved non-vacuous by counting the dispatches on which the craft moves the oracle:
 *        (a) bandBelow — bottom with OBJ_X below the band.
 *        (b) edgeJustAbove — one row short of the threshold, inside the band.
 *        (c) edgeAtThreshold — exactly at the threshold, inside the band.
 *        (d) retireBaseKind — retirement of a kind-0 record (attract's one retirement is kind 1), so
 *            the phase write is skipped.
 *        (e) retireAlreadyLatched — latch already holding 2, so the latch write is skipped and its
 *            value must survive (reachability not claimed; the arm pins the comparison).
 *   3. CONTRACT: work/sprite/video RAM MINUS STACK_SCRATCH plus the returned protocol value. The
 *      dissolved candidate is a plain JS call owning no guest stack; the oracle still splices through
 *      it (its retire arm pops the caller's return), so SP, pc and dead scratch below SP legitimately
 *      differ and are excluded.
 *   4. LIVE — retired (see the skip below).
 *   5. TEETH — the test asserts WHICH half catches each. Five escape natural and are caught by a
 *      crafted arm (Y threshold low->b, Y threshold high->c, band low edge dropped->a, phase write
 *      unconditional->d, one-shot latch dropped->e); three are caught naturally (band high edge off
 *      by one -> RAM on the single OBJ_X == 42; column blank dropped -> RAM; wrong protocol value ->
 *      the RETURN comparison). The old "leaked return bracket" twin is retired (pc-only, no longer
 *      produced or compared).
 *
