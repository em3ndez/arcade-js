/**
 * Equivalence test for clearTilemapAndSprites (ROM 0x0852) — the full-screen wipe
 * (blank ALL 1024 tilemap cells + zero the 384-byte sprite shadow buffer).
 *
 * sub_0852 WRITES memory (video RAM 0x7400-0x77FF <- 0x10, and work RAM
 * 0x6900-0x6A7F <- 0x00) and reads NOTHING — every operand is an immediate, so it
 * is an input-free, straight-line constant memory transform. It is validated by
 * capture/clone/replay on a FRESH clone per side (a memory-writing routine demands
 * that), never on the full register file, never on cycles. The contract compared is
 * RAM (minus STACK_SCRATCH); there are no live-out registers (the header explains
 * both callers reload A/DE before reading, so A/BC/DE/HL/F are dead ABI). SP and PC
 * are likewise not compared — the oracle's terminal `ret` pops the stack (SP += 2)
 * and vectors PC; the idiomatic layer drops that bookkeeping (the JS call stack
 * replaces it).
 *
 * Because sub_0852 is UNREACHED in attract (its callers loc_0986 / loc_196b are
 * in-game phase arms — 0 dispatches over 3000 frames), there is no real dispatch to
 * capture; the gate is crafted-entry, which is COMPLETE here precisely because the
 * routine reads nothing:
 *
 *   1. CRAFTED (footprint) — from a realistic attract-derived base machine, paint
 *      every cell the routine could touch — all of video RAM (0x7400-0x77FF,
 *      covering the tilemap fill) and a guard-banded span around the sprite buffer
 *      (0x68F0-0x6A8F, catching an over-write past either end) — with a SENTINEL
 *      distinct from the fill bytes (0x10 / 0x00), identically on both sides. Any
 *      cell the candidate writes-but-oracle-doesn't (or misses) then holds the
 *      sentinel on one side and a fill byte on the other, so the RAM gate bites.
 *      Several sentinels x several base frames are swept.
 *
 *   2. TEETH — a deliberately-broken twin (a one-cell-short tilemap fill: skips the
 *      last cell 0x77FF) MUST be caught. On the sentinel entry the dropped cell
 *      holds the sentinel vs the oracle's 0x10, so the RAM gate bites at exactly
 *      0x77FF.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-0852.test.js
