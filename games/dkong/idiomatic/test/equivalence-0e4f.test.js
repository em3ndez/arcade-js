/**
 * Memory-equivalence test for drawLadder (ROM 0x0E4F) — the board-layout renderer's
 * kind-2 LADDER drawer: walks DOWN the tilemap laying a (up to two-wide, optionally
 * slanting) ladder run, paying the height counter 0x63B1 down 8 px per row, then steps
 * the record cursor DE past the record.
 *
 * This is the CYCLE-FREE / memory-equivalence gate (docs/decompiler-pipeline), not the retired strict
 * whole-machine one. drawLadder WRITES memory (0x63B5 tile code, 0x63B1 height, and the
 * tilemap VRAM cells) and, on the kind != 2 arm, calls a subroutine, so every case uses
 * a FRESH clone per side (never a reused machine). The oracle (translated loc_0e4f) is
 * run on one clone and drawLadder on another, then compared on the go-forward contract:
 *
 *     RAM (dumpState, minus STACK_SCRATCH) + SP + declared live-out DE.
 *
 * dumpState covers work + sprite + VIDEO RAM, so both the 0x63B1/0x63B5 scratch and the
 * tile stamps — this routine's whole point — are inside the compared state. DE is the
 * live-out: the successor sub_0da7 (0x0DA7) does `ld a,(de)` first thing, so the advanced
 * cursor must match. SP is compared and is trivially equal (neither side touches the
 * stack; m.call adds no push). pc is NOT compared: the oracle's tail chain leaves pc in a
 * callee / 0x0DA7, but that tail is structural in the direct-call layer. A / HL / BC are
 * dead at the tail (the walk and its dispatch overwrite them) so they are neither
 * reproduced nor compared.
 *
 * Attract renders this for real on every 25m ladder — all captured dispatches are kind 2,
 * and they naturally span straight (x-delta 0), slant-right (0x07/0x0C) and slant-left
 * (0xF4/0xFD) runs over real heights, so the stamp loop, both descend blocks, and both
 * slant arms are exercised by real states. The kind != 2 DELEGATION (to drawCappedTileColumn)
 * is unreached in attract, so it is a CRAFTED entry (docs/decompiler-pipeline): a real render-walk state with
 * a surgical kind nudge, identical on both sides.
 *
 * Jobs:
 *   1. EQUAL (captured dispatches) — hook 0x0E4F in a real attract run; on each true
 *      dispatch, oracle vs drawLadder leave identical RAM (−stack) + SP + DE. Reports the
 *      x-delta and height distribution actually exercised.
 *   2. WRITE-SET (captured) — the oracle's only writes are 0x63B1, 0x63B5, and VIDEO-RAM
 *      tile cells; documents the exact footprint.
 *   3. CRAFTED (kind != 2 delegation) — poke the record kind to 3/4/5/6/7 identically on
 *      both sides so the routine hands off to drawCappedTileColumn (kind 3 = capped column;
 *      4/5/6 = uniform fill; 7 = bail); confirm oracle == drawLadder including the DE the
 *      callee advances.
 *   4. CRAFTED (row-boundary early exit) — the slant-right path ends the run early when a
 *      shift lands the write pointer on a 32-cell row boundary (block 0x0EC9's `and 0x1f`
 *      exit). Attract never hits it — real ladders always exit by exhausting the height —
 *      so it is crafted: a slant-right run started on a row-aligned column, identically on
 *      both sides. Confirms oracle == drawLadder AND that the run really stopped on the
 *      boundary (height left unspent) rather than running to exhaustion.
 *
 *      The band-edge column shifts (0xF8 wrap / 0xF0 re-seat) need no crafting: the real
 *      captured dispatches in job 1 hit them naturally (8 wraps + 8 re-seats across the 18).
 *   5. TEETH (paired tile) — a twin that lays the paired half-tile as (tile − 0x08) instead
 *      of (tile − 0x10) MUST be caught in the tilemap VRAM.
 *   6. TEETH (live-out DE) — a twin that forgets to advance DE MUST be caught by the DE
 *      comparison; a gate blind to the record cursor would let the walk desync silently.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-0e4f.test.js
