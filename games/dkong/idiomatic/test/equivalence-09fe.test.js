/**
 * Equivalence test for restorePlayer2Context (ROM 0x09FE) — the PLAYER-2 CONTEXT
 * RESTORE: copy P2's saved 8-byte context into the live player block
 * (LIVES..HOW_HIGH_LAST_SEQ, 0x6228-0x622F), re-derive BOARD (0x6227) from the
 * restored board-sequence pointer, and arm the sub-state machine
 * (SUBSTATE_TIMER 0x6009 = 0x78, GAME_SUBSTATE 0x600A = 4).
 *
 * restorePlayer2Context WRITES memory and is reached by dispatch (dispatchGameState,
 * the NMI's rst-0x28 game-state dispatch) — not a pure leaf — so it is gated by
 * capture / clone / replay (docs/decompiler-pipeline), with a FRESH clone per case. It is straight-
 * line (no data-dependent branch — unlike its P1 twin loc_09ab, which branches on
 * TWO_PLAYER_GAME), so real captures + crafted entries are full path coverage.
 *
 * REACHABILITY. 0x09FE is NEVER reached in attract, nor at a 1-player start, nor
 * even at a 2-player START — it needs control to pass to player 2, i.e. player 1
 * must lose a life in a credited 2-player game. The capture drives that the cheap
 * deterministic way: TWO coins + START2, then leave Mario idle so the bonus timer
 * expires and player 1 dies; control passes to player 2 and 0x09FE dispatches
 * (~frame 1661, stable). A 1700-frame window covers it. (Same tape and timing the
 * optimized-layer test used.)
 *
 *   1. EQUAL (captured) — hook 0x09FE in that driven run, clone the machine at each
 *      true dispatch (FRESH clone per case, since it writes RAM), run the ORACLE on
 *      one clone and restorePlayer2Context on another, and confirm IDENTICAL RAM
 *      everywhere game-visible (minus the dead STACK_SCRATCH). Also confirm the
 *      idiomatic routine leaves SP + pc unchanged (JS return replaces the modelled
 *      `ret`) and actually did its work (block == save slot, BOARD == *ptr,
 *      timer/substate armed) so EQUAL is not vacuous.
 *
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted) — from a real entry, poke IDENTICALLY on both sides: distinct
 *      board-sequence pointers (P2's saved SEQPTR at 0x604A/0x604B) to exercise the
 *      BOARD deref across values, distinct save-slot payloads to prove the copy is
 *      faithful, and pre-dirtied destination/output bytes to prove every write is
 *      unconditional. Confirm oracle == idiomatic and the derived outputs.
 *
 *   3. TEETH (captured) — a deliberately-broken twin that SWAPS the two arm
 *      constants (writes 4 to SUBSTATE_TIMER, 0x78 to GAME_SUBSTATE) MUST be caught
 *      by the captured sweep, naming 0x6009 (the lowest-address, always-divergent
 *      output). A gate a real corruption slips through is worthless.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-09fe.test.js
