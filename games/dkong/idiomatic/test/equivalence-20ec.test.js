/**
 * Equivalence gate for advanceFallingBarrel (ROM 0x20EC) — swap to the shadow register set, step one airborne
 * object along its arc, and pick one of three continuations from the object's OBJ_Y against the
 * snapshot in record byte +25. The two callees it invokes (ROM 0x239C the ballistic step, ROM
 * 0x2A2F the girder probe) are already idiomatic and are wired on BOTH sides of every comparison
 * here, so they are not what is under test; the three continuations are still frozen and run as the
 * same oracle on both sides. What this gate has to prove is the head: the register-bank swap, the
 * re-arm comparison including its 8-bit wrap, which continuation is chosen, and that the
 * continuation's result travels back out.
 *
 *   0. REACHABILITY — how many real dispatches a 1200-frame attract run produces, how many distinct
 *      entry shapes, and which continuation each one takes. The arm label is derived from the
 *      GATE'S OWN ORACLE (by watching which address the oracle's registry dispatch reaches first),
 *      never from the rewrite, so nothing here is circular. Attract turns out to reach ALL THREE
 *      continuations unaided, which is why arm 2 is about frontiers rather than about arms.
 *
 *   1. EQUAL (captured) — replayed INLINE AT THE DISPATCH: at each one the host rehosts the entry
 *      state into a FRESH override-free Machine, clones it twice, runs the oracle on one and the
 *      rewrite on the other, compares, and discards. EVERY dispatch is replayed; nothing is sampled.
 *      Rehosting rather than cloning the host is what makes that affordable and correct — this
 *      routine's continuation re-enters the object loop that dispatches it, so a clone of the host
 *      would carry the capturing override back into the replay and recurse.
 *      Compared: WHICH continuation was entered, every live cell of the state dump, SP, the program
 *      counter and the return value. The continuation is compared explicitly because the three
 *      RECONVERGE — ROM 0x2101's gate hands most states straight on to ROM 0x2104 — so choosing the
 *      wrong one can leave live RAM identical, which is measured to happen on the crafted entries
 *      of arm 2. The dead stack scratch is EXCLUDED and reported separately: the rewrite dissolves
 *      the two call brackets the oracle places around its callees, so the oracle's transient return
 *      addresses have no counterpart there. That is the expected difference, not a defect, and the
 *      count of captures showing it is printed.
 *
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted: two frontiers attract does not provide) — every capture is re-run with
 *      record byte +25 poked to the exact re-arm boundary and to one past it, which pins the
 *      comparison in both directions; and with the record poked to a sub-26 OBJ_Y, where the 8-bit
 *      subtraction wraps, in both a passing and a blocking configuration. Each craft asserts, using
 *      the oracle, that it really reached the intended continuation, so it cannot silently
 *      degenerate into more of arm 1.
 *
 *   3. PROTOCOL (stubbed continuations) — all three continuations are replaced, on each fresh clone,
 *      by stubs that record their invocation and hand back a sentinel. The expected sequence and
 *      value come from the ORACLE driven through the same stubs. This is the arm with teeth on the
 *      RETURN VALUE, and it is not optional: the oracle returns `undefined` on all 177 real
 *      dispatches, so a rewrite that swallowed its continuation's result would be invisible
 *      everywhere else. Stubbing the continuations also strips the enormous downstream chain out of
 *      the RAM comparison, which is what makes this arm able to point at the head's own writes.
 *
 *   4. LIVE-WIRE — the rewrite drives a whole 1400-frame attract run as a registered override, and
 *      every frame of the state trace must match a baseline that differs in EXACTLY ONE THING. The
 *      baseline is not an all-oracle machine: it wires the same two idiomatic callees this rewrite
 *      direct-calls and swaps only ROM 0x20EC back to its oracle. Both sides run under the
 *      cycle-free engine at the manifest's vblank poll PC, so the T-states the rewrite does not
 *      charge move nothing — the NMI is timed by control flow there, not by a clock. The comparison
 *      is the FULL dump INCLUDING the stack scratch: the brackets the rewrite dissolves are
 *      transient and the main loop has overwritten those bytes by the time a frame is sampled, so
 *      they legitimately hold here even though they cannot hold per-dispatch. The dispatch count is
 *      asserted non-zero and pinned, because a live arm that never runs the routine passes green.
 *
 *   5. LIVE-WIRE CONTROL — the same run wired with a broken twin must fork, so arm 4 is shown to be
 *      sensitive; and the wrap twin is confirmed to survive arm 4 untouched, which is the measured
 *      reason arm 2 is not optional.
 *
 *   6. TEETH — four broken twins, caught by disjoint arms:
 *        (a) no bank swap   — drops the `exx`. Caught by the captures, and it takes the live run
 *                             down 794 frames early rather than diverging, so the harness treats a
 *                             thrown fault as a result.
 *        (b) swapped tails  — contact and no-contact continuations exchanged. Caught by the
 *                             captures on live RAM, and by the live run.
 *        (c) signed compare — drops the 8-bit wrap on the re-arm subtraction. INVISIBLE to the
 *                             captures and to the whole live run (attract never presents an OBJ_Y
 *                             under 26); caught ONLY by the crafted wrap entries, and there only by
 *                             the continuation check — on those entries the two arms reconverge and
 *                             leave identical live RAM, SP, pc and return value.
 *        (d) swallowed result — correct control flow, hands back nothing. Invisible to RAM, SP, pc
 *                             and even to the captured return comparison, because the oracle also
 *                             returns undefined there; caught ONLY by the stubbed protocol arm.
 *
 * COVERAGE THIS DOES NOT CLAIM: attract only, plus pokes and stubs on top of attract state. No
 * credited game, no board past 25m, and one record base only (0x6700) — attract activates no other
 * slot through this branch.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT, DERIVED — cross-file, and therefore recorded here rather than in the routine. The
 * oracle leaves the accumulator holding the gate's difference and the shadow B holding the +25
 * snapshot; both are dead. Every continuation overwrites the accumulator with its first instruction
 * (ROM 0x2104 and 0x2118 load it from the record, ROM 0x2101 reaches ROM 0x24B4 which does the
 * same), and every routine reachable before ROM 0x21BA swaps the banks back either never touches B
 * or writes B/BC before reading it (ROM 0x1FE5, 0x1FEF, 0x215F, 0x2407) — the one genuine read, the
 * loop's own slot counter at ROM 0x1F8D, runs after that swap and so reads the main-set copy, not
 * this one. The flags are dead for the same reason as the accumulator. Arm 4 is the measurement:
 * the live-wire run reproduces the baseline byte-for-byte over its 1400 frames with the shadow-B
 * write dropped.
 *
 * ALSO CROSS-FILE, so it lives here: ROM 0x32D6 zeroes a +25 as well, but on the record family
 * reached through 0x63C8, not through the slot array this branch walks. And record byte +25 has
 * exactly one writer in this object cascade — ROM 0x2146, on the arm the CONTACT continuation leads
 * to — which stores a copy of the record's own OBJ_Y there. That is what makes +25 a snapshot of
 * the last registered contact, and the comparison a re-arm distance.
