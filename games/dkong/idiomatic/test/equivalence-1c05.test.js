/**
 * Equivalence test for loc_1c05 (ROM 0x1C05) — the airborne-frame resolver: run the descent
 * probe, then take one of four tails (settle the landing / re-run the fall-height test /
 * carry on as an ordinary airborne frame / arm the fall-height test and run the object-overlap
 * search).
 *
 * WHAT THIS GATE ACTUALLY COVERS, stated plainly:
 *
 *   1. REALISM (captured, ATTRACT ONLY). 0x1C05 is richly reachable without input: hooking it
 *      through a plain 6000-frame attract run captures 360 real dispatches, and all four tails
 *      fire there. The replay is SAMPLED — every 20th capture, plus the first at each distinct
 *      entry shape (board / land-check / airborne-frame count), plus the first of each observed
 *      tail chain — and the test asserts in-test that the sample covers every shape and every
 *      chain it saw, so the sampling cannot silently drop an arm. The counts it replayed are
 *      printed by the run. Credited gameplay, the other three boards in PLAY, and two-player
 *      are NOT covered by this part; boards 2/3/4 are reached only by the crafted arm below.
 *
 *   2. DISSOLVED-FORM NOTE. loc_1c05 was dissolved: `m.push16(0x1c08); m.call(0x2b1c)` became a
 *      direct `loc_2b1c(m)` call (and the overlap search's bracket likewise fell away). A stub
 *      installed at ROM 0x2B1C is therefore BYPASSED by the candidate, which no longer dispatches
 *      through the seam. The old crafted arm that swept all 256 synthetic verdict bytes through such
 *      a stub is RETIRED — the real loc_2b1c produces only real verdicts, so the sweep cannot run
 *      stub-free — and is backstopped by the REALISM arm and the TEETH verdict twin (see its note).
 *
 *   3. EQUAL (crafted, STUB-FREE). One crafted arm survives, made stub-free: a real trigger-frame
 *      capture (the one attract takes down the overlap tail) is driven on boards 2, 3 and 4, whose
 *      per-board overlap arms attract never dispatches from here. Both sides run the real descent
 *      probe and the real overlap search; equivalence proves the candidate drives each board's arm
 *      as the oracle does, and a delegating counter over the oracle's own run confirms each board
 *      reached the 0x2853 search (non-vacuity).
 *
 *   4. TEETH — five broken twins, each of which the suite MUST catch:
 *      (a) verdict predicate off by one (0 selects the landing tail, not 1).
 *      (b) trigger frame off by one (21 instead of 20).
 *      (c) dropped land-check arm.
 *      (d) dropped ITEM_COLLECTED latch.
 *      (e) inverted severity test.
 *
 * CONTRACT. RAM MINUS STACK_SCRATCH [0x6BE0,0x6C00), plus the propagated return value. The oracle's
 * two call brackets (the descent probe's and the overlap search's) land in that dead stack region,
 * and the REALISM arm asserts at least one real dispatch differs ONLY inside it, so the exclusion is
 * load-bearing rather than decorative. The dissolved candidate opens no guest bracket of its own —
 * it calls loc_2b1c and every tail directly — so pc and SP are NOT part of this contract (they were
 * compared only under the old seam form, which owned a live bracket); the whole-game SP tests guard
 * SP-correctness. The result register is likewise not asserted — it differs on every dispatch, the
 * measurement behind the routine's memory-only live-out.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-1c05.test.js
