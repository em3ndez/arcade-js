 * Memory-equivalence test for stamp50mBoardTiles (ROM 0x3FA6) — "on the 50m board
 * only, stamp four tilemap cells": gate on BOARD == 2 via boardBitGate (mask 0x02),
 * and on the open arm write 0x10/0xC0 into the cell pairs 0x776C/0x776E and
 * 0x748C/0x748E; off the 50m board, write nothing.
 *
 * This is the CYCLE-FREE / memory-equivalence gate (docs/decompiler-pipeline), not the retired strict
 * whole-machine one. The routine WRITES video RAM on the open arm, so every case uses
 * a FRESH clone per side. The oracle runs on one clone, stamp50mBoardTiles on another,
 * and they are compared on the go-forward contract:
 *
 *     RAM (dumpState, minus STACK_SCRATCH) only.
 *
 * pc and SP are deliberately NOT compared. The oracle uses m.step/m.push16/m.call/
 * m.ret, so it advances pc to the return target and moves SP; both are the modelled
 * step/stack ABI the direct-call layer replaces with a JS return + boolean gate.
 * Memory is the only live-out: loc_3fa0's next act after `call 0x3FA6` is `jp 0x0D5F`,
 * with no flag branch and no read of any register this leaves. (The gate's own
 * caller-skip `pop hl` on the closed arm lands in the dead STACK_SCRATCH region, which
 * the contract masks — so the closed arm's only oracle writes vanish under the mask.)
 *
 * REACHABILITY — BOTH arms are hit by REAL captured dispatches:
 *   - CLOSED arm: plain 25m attract. loc_3fa0 dispatches 0x3FA6 during the boot board
 *     setup (frame 0) with BOARD == 1; the gate (mask bit1) is closed, so the oracle
 *     writes only dead stack and the routine stamps nothing.
 *   - OPEN arm: attract only ever plays 25m, so board 2 is forced with an IDENTICAL-
 *     BOTH-SIDES board poke (Karl-sanctioned "poke the board state to reach a state for
 *     validation"): at frame 100 set GAME_STATE=3, GAME_SUBSTATE=10 (board setup),
 *     SUBSTATE_TIMER=1, BOARD=2 (50m). The 50m setup pass then dispatches 0x3FA6 once
 *     with the gate OPEN, giving a REAL captured entry (real registers, stack, board).
 *
 * Jobs:
 *   1. EQUAL (closed arm, real attract) — oracle vs stamp50mBoardTiles on fresh clones
 *      of the real board-1 entry leave identical RAM (−stack); neither touches the four
 *      target cells (documents the "writes nothing off 50m" arm).
 *   2. EQUAL (open arm, real forced board-2) — identical RAM (−stack); both leave the
 *      four cells holding 0x10/0xC0/0x10/0xC0.
 *   3. WRITE-SET (open arm) — the oracle's ONLY non-stack writes are exactly the four
 *      cells with the exact values. Documents the footprint.
 *   4. CRAFTED (board-2 poke on a real board-1 entry) — flip the gate open by poking
 *      BOARD=2 identically both sides; (a) pre-dirty the four cells to 0xAA and confirm
 *      both stamp the motif over the dirt, (b) garbage registers + far RAM identically
 *      to show the constant output is input-independent.
 *   5. TEETH — the documented sub_3fa6 hoist trap: a twin that (loop-invariant-hoists
 *      the HL reload and so) writes the 0x748C pair twice and NEVER writes the 0x776C
 *      pair MUST be caught, naming 0x776C, on both a real and a crafted-dirtied state.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-3fa6.test.js
