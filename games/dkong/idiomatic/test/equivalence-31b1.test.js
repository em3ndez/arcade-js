/**
 * Equivalence test for advanceLiveFires (ROM 0x31B1) — the five-record sweep of the 0x6400
 * object array.
 *
 * The routine runs armAlternateFireModeAtHighDifficulty, then five times: advance OBJ_ITER_PTR by one stride, store
 * it back, and call ROM 0x3202 when the record's occupancy flag (+0) is non-zero. The
 * pointer and the sweep index (0x63A2) both live in MEMORY and are re-read every
 * iteration, so a callee that rewrites either one steers the rest of the sweep.
 *
 * CONTRACT COMPARED HERE: work/sprite/video RAM minus STACK_SCRATCH, plus the return value. The
 * dissolved advanceLiveFires is SP-neutral — it DIRECT-calls advanceFire and owns no guest-stack
 * bracket — so pc and SP are NOT compared (the earlier arm compared them only because the seam form
 * left a live bracket; that is gone). The oracle still splices through the guest stack, so the two
 * return-address bytes it writes land in the dead STACK_SCRATCH and are excluded. The whole-game SP
 * tests are what now guard SP-correctness; this file does not.
 *
 * ONE-LEVEL-DEEPER DISSOLUTION — why the crafted arms changed shape. advanceLiveFires no longer
 * calls `m.call(0x3202)`; it calls advanceFire directly. A stub installed at 0x3202 is therefore
 * BYPASSED by the candidate, so the old marker/steering stubs (which stood in for the object body)
 * could no longer be compared against it. The crafted equivalence now runs both sides on the REAL
 * object body and proves the call with a delegating counter; the stub survives only where the caller
 * keeps the seam — the TEETH twins, which are written `m.call(0x3202)`.
 *
 * WHAT EACH TEST ACTUALLY COVERS — read this before trusting a green run:
 *
 *   1. CAPTURED (real dispatches). 0x31B1 is dispatched 481 times in a 3000-frame
 *      attract run. Sampling policy: every 20th capture PLUS the first capture at each
 *      distinct entry shape (the five occupancy flags), and the test asserts the sample
 *      covers every shape seen. ATTRACT PRESENTS EXACTLY ONE SHAPE — record 0 occupied,
 *      records 1-4 empty — so the captures prove the real path and nothing about the
 *      other 31 occupancy patterns. Those are the crafted cases below. Both sides run the
 *      real object body (advanceFire on the candidate, frozen loc_3202 on the oracle),
 *      memory-equivalent by advanceFire's own gate.
 *
 *   2. CRAFTED (occupancy, all 32 patterns). On a real attract base, STUB-FREE: both sides
 *      run the real object body, and equivalence proves advanceLiveFires visits the same
 *      records the oracle does. Non-vacuity comes from a DELEGATING counter over the
 *      ORACLE's sweep — a 0x3202 override that records the record base and then delegates to
 *      the frozen loc_3202 — asserting the call landed on exactly the occupied records and
 *      the sweep ran its five iterations. (The retired marker stub gave the same
 *      observability by REPLACING the body; the counter gives it without displacing it.)
 *
 *   3. CRAFTED (callee steering) — RETIRED as a real-candidate arm. It stubbed 0x3202 to
 *      steer OBJ_ITER_PTR / the sweep index mid-pass; the dissolved candidate bypasses the
 *      stub, so that steer can no longer be injected into it. The property — both cells are
 *      re-read from memory each iteration — is still gated by the occupancy arm (the real
 *      advanceFire moves OBJ_ITER_PTR, so a pointer held in a local diverges in RAM) and by
 *      the TEETH "local-index" twin, which keeps the seam call and still routes through the
 *      steering stub. See the note at its old position.
 *
 *   4. LIVE (whole-machine). The candidate is wired at 0x31B1 for a 3000-frame attract
 *      run and every frame's state dump is compared against the all-oracle baseline,
 *      minus STACK_SCRATCH. THE OVERRIDE RESTORES THE ORACLE'S MEASURED CYCLE COST
 *      (measured per dispatch by running the oracle on a clone): cycle-free code
 *      under-charges, which shifts the vblank NMI and diverges for reasons that have
 *      nothing to do with this routine. Drop the `mm.tick(...)` line below and this run
 *      diverges at frame 870 (measured, on the same rewrite that passes with it).
 *      Attract only; gameplay is NOT covered by any test here.
 *
 *   5. LIVE-OUT. The registers this routine defines and the candidate drops — measured to
 *      be exactly A, F, B, C, H, L — are scrambled after every ORACLE dispatch across the
 *      same 3000-frame attract run. The trace stays byte-identical, so nothing downstream
 *      reads them. Attract only, again: this measures the states attract reaches.
 *
 *   6. TEETH — four deliberately-broken twins the cases above MUST catch:
 *        (a) the pointer kept in a local, written back only once;
 *        (b) the pointer advanced AFTER the record is read (record 0 skipped, a sixth
 *            record visited);
 *        (c) the sweep index kept in a local instead of re-read from memory;
 *        (d) the 0x3202 call skipped.
 *
 * LIVE-OUT, DERIVED — cross-file, and therefore recorded here rather than in the routine. The sole
 * caller — ROM 0x30ED, whose `call 0x31B1` at 0x30F3 is the only one in the translated layer — goes
 * straight on to `call 0x34F3` (publishFireSprites), which loads its own source/destination
 * pointers and record count and re-sets the flags before it reads anything, so A/F/B/H/L are dead
 * within one instruction of the return; C survives that callee, and was followed out through the
 * next two call levels (ROM 0x2E04's prologue and the two rst targets it enters) without being
 * read. Arm 5 is the measurement.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-31b1.test.js
