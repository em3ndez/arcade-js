 * Equivalence test for loc_13aa (ROM 0x13AA) — the small in-game state reset
 * (0x0702 sub-state table idx 18): flip-screen ← DIP, GAME_SUBSTATE ← 0,
 * CURRENT_PLAYER/0x600E ← 1.
 *
 * loc_13aa's entire memory-observable behaviour is a TOTAL FUNCTION of exactly one
 * input byte, DIP_UPRIGHT (0x6026): it reads that byte, copies it to the flip-screen
 * latch, and otherwise writes three fixed values (0x600A ← 0, 0x600D ← 1, 0x600E ← 1).
 * So it is validated the strongest way — EXHAUSTIVELY over that one byte:
 *
 *   1. EQUAL (exhaustive) — loc_13aa == oracle over ALL 256 DIP_UPRIGHT values,
 *      compared on RAM − STACK_SCRATCH (the memory-equivalence contract) AND the
 *      flip-screen latch. The base entry seeds 0x600A/0x600D/0x600E to non-target
 *      SENTINELS so each of the routine's writes is observable (a dropped write would
 *      leave a sentinel behind and diverge). The oracle's terminal `ret` pops the
 *      stack inside STACK_SCRATCH (SP set there) and is excluded; the direct-call
 *      candidate leaves the stack alone. 256 values is the complete input space.
 *
 *      NB the flip-screen write targets 0x7D82, an I/O latch the memory seam routes to
 *      io.writeFlipScreen(value & 1). dumpState() captures work + sprite + video RAM
 *      only, NOT that latch — so io.flipScreen is compared EXPLICITLY here, or the
 *      flip write would carry no teeth.
 *
 *   2. TEETH (exhaustive) — three deliberately-broken twins, one per effect the
 *      routine owns, each of which the sweep MUST catch:
 *        (a) broken-flip     — writes a constant 0 to the flip latch instead of the DIP;
 *            caught by the io.flipScreen compare on the odd-DIP rows.
 *        (b) broken-substate — drops the GAME_SUBSTATE clear; caught by the 0x600A diff
 *            (the sentinel survives).
 *        (c) broken-player   — writes CURRENT_PLAYER = 0 instead of 1; caught by the
 *            0x600D diff.
 *
 *   3. REALISM (crafted onto real credited-game states) — attract never dispatches an
 *      in-game sub-state, so we drive a coin+start game, hook 0x06fe (the in-game
 *      sub-state dispatcher, which fires every in-game frame), and clone REAL
 *      credited-game states. Onto each — keeping its full real RAM background — we poke
 *      only DIP_UPRIGHT (a few values) and a safe SP, then confirm loc_13aa reproduces
 *      the oracle's RAM − STACK_SCRATCH and flip latch against a realistic machine, not
 *      just a fresh boot.
 *
 * Contract: RAM − STACK_SCRATCH + io.flipScreen. LIVE-OUT is memory + that latch; SP/PC
 * are the Z80 `ret` the direct-call return replaces and the dispatcher ignores the
 * handler's residual registers/flags — so neither is compared (never the full register
 * file, never cycles).
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-13aa.test.js
