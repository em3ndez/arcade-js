/**
 * Equivalence test for loc_20e1 (ROM 0x20E1) — the arm that stamps a +1.0 px/frame horizontal
 * velocity onto an object record before the shared launch tail at ROM 0x20C3.
 *
 * WHAT IS COMPARED — the memory-equivalence contract for the DISSOLVED form. loc_20e1 no longer
 * reaches its tail through m.call(0x20c3): it DIRECT-CALLS the idiomatic loc_20c3, which direct-calls
 * loc_2407 / publishBarrelSprite / loc_1f8d, down to the still-frozen m.call(0x1f83). The frozen
 * oracle jp-tails to that same boundary at the same guest SP (a jp pushes nothing), so both sides
 * run the rest of the object loop and, measured, leave RAM outside the stack window and the final SP
 * identical. So this gate asserts:
 *   - RAM EXCLUDING the STACK_SCRATCH window {0x6be0,0x6c00}: the frozen side's call/ret bracket
 *     writes a return address into that window at an SP the JS side does not push to, so the two
 *     runs legitimately differ there and nowhere else;
 *   - this routine's OWN ordered store sequence — its two writes to the record's velocity bytes,
 *     isolated by address so the tail chain's writes are not mixed in. This is the only half that
 *     sees a value-neutral dropped store (a fraction store dropped when the fraction was already 0);
 *   - the final guest SP (a stray push in the dissolved form lands in the excluded window yet still
 *     moves SP, so this stays load-bearing);
 *   - the propagated return value.
 * pc and the rest of the register file are dropped with the frozen call bracket that used to justify
 * them; cycles are NOT compared (the rewrite is cycle-free), and test 3's LIVE run restores the
 * fragment's true oracle cost per dispatch instead.
 *
 *   0. REACHABILITY — 0x20E1 is dispatched naturally during attract. The test measures the count,
 *      the record bases, and the entry shapes, and asserts BOTH that attract reaches this routine
 *      and that it delivers only ONE shape of entry (velocity -0x00A0, at OBJ_X 16, every time) —
 *      the honest hole the crafted cases exist to fill, asserted so it cannot quietly become
 *      coverage, and the producing line for the entry numbers the routine header quotes.
 *   1. EQUAL (captured) — EVERY captured dispatch replayed on fresh clones. No sampling: the
 *      natural count is small and test 0 asserts the capture is complete.
 *   3. LIVE (whole attract) — the live-out measurement: the candidate wired at 0x20E1 for a real
 *      4000-frame attract run, its frame trace diffed against the all-oracle baseline on every
 *      cell outside STACK_SCRATCH.
 *      ★ loc_20e1 is cycle-free and, dissolved, so is the whole 0x20C3/0x21BA/0x1F8D fragment below
 *      it; its true oracle cost is measured PER DISPATCH (priceDissolved, up to the frozen walk-step
 *      boundary) and charged back inside the override. Without that the run diverges purely because
 *      cycle-free code shifts the NMI — carried as a teeth case so the restoration cannot be dropped
 *      silently.
 *      COVERAGE: attract only. Gameplay, the other three boards and every crafted shape in test 4
 *      are NOT exercised live.
 *   4. EQUAL (crafted) — the entry shapes attract never delivers, each a real captured state with
 *      one surgical poke applied identically to both sides: the velocity already rightward, zero,
 *      a large positive whole part, and a zero fraction. Record-relativity needs no craft — the
 *      captures already span 7 distinct record bases — but one crafted base nudge is included too.
 *   5. OBSERVED EFFECT — the one test here that is NOT an equivalence check, and says so: it runs
 *      the ORACLE in plain attract and asserts the record's OBJ_X then steps +1 per frame. It
 *      grounds the routine header's role line against the real ROM's downstream behaviour, and it
 *      passes or fails regardless of what the candidate does.
 *   6. TEETH — five broken twins, each of which this contract MUST catch, plus the two
 *      pinning cases below them.
 *
 * ON THE CAPTURE HOOK AND RE-ENTRY. The tail runs the rest of the object loop, which can dispatch
 * 0x20E1 again for a later slot. A clone carries the source machine's override map, so those nested
 * dispatches resolve to the capture hook — which is disarmed once the host run is over, and which
 * delegates to the oracle. That is the callee-is-oracle isolation the unit gate wants, applied to a
 * routine that can re-enter itself: one dispatch of the candidate per comparison, oracle underneath
 * on both sides.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-20e1.test.js
