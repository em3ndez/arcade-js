/**
 * Equivalence test for latchHammerTouch (ROM 0x2954) — the hammer-touch latch: gate on the board, test
 * Mario against the two-record hammer pair, store the overlap flag into MARIO_HAMMER_PENDING,
 * pulse the item/score sound trigger, and mark the touched record as the pair's selected one.
 *
 * CONTRACT. The routine's live-out is MEMORY ONLY plus control flow. It returns nothing, and its
 * caller chain (ROM 0x1C33 falls into the player-sprite copy at 0x1DA6, whose first two actions
 * reload the accumulator and its pointer from memory) reads no register or flag it leaves
 * behind. So each case compares:
 *   - work RAM minus the dead STACK_SCRATCH region,
 *   - pc and SP,
 *   - the RETURN VALUE (undefined on every arm, on both sides).
 * The register file is deliberately NOT compared: the oracle's terminal `ld a,b / and a / cp 1`
 * leaves the accumulator holding the residue while the idiomatic form leaves it holding the
 * overlap flag, and on the closed-gate arm the oracle's rst-0x30 rotates A and zeroes B. Both
 * are dead — see the reasoning above.
 *
 * STACK. The oracle brackets two calls with real Z80 pushes (its rst-0x30 return address and the
 * `call 0x2974` return address, plus what those callees push), and every arm ends with a single
 * net caller-return: the open gate returns through the routine's own `ret`, and the CLOSED gate
 * returns through rst-0x30's `pop hl / ret`, which discards the routine's own return address
 * instead. Both leave pc = the caller's return address and SP = entry + 2. The idiomatic form
 * models no stack, so the harness performs exactly ONE terminal `m.ret()` after the candidate to
 * line pc/SP up. The bytes the oracle's bracket leaves behind land in STACK_SCRATCH — measured
 * at a real dispatch: SP enters at 0x6BEA and the deepest push reaches 0x6BE4, inside the
 * [0x6BE0, 0x6C00) region — and are excluded from the memory compare.
 *
 *   0. REACHABILITY — 0x2954 IS naturally reachable: the 25m attract demo jumps at hammers and
 *      dispatches it 4x in 2000 frames (14x in 12000).
 *
 *   1. EQUAL (captured) — hook 0x2954 in a real attract run and confirm latchHammerTouch == oracle on
 *      every real dispatch. Those four dispatches already span the no-overlap arm and one
 *      genuine record-1 hammer touch, but four is thin, hence case 2.
 *
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted) — a real attract state with the two records, Mario's X/Y and BOARD poked
 *      identically on both sides, pinning every arm: the closed board gate (75m), a miss that
 *      must CLEAR an already-set latch and sound, a hit on the pair's first record, a hit on its
 *      second, and both-active (the first wins). Each asserts the oracle's ABSOLUTE cell values
 *      as well as oracle == candidate, so a both-sides-wrong reading cannot pass.
 *
 *   3. TEETH — four broken twins the same suite MUST catch: one that marks the wrong record of
 *      the pair, one that skips the unconditional clear on a miss, one that asserts the sound
 *      for the usual 3 frames instead of 64, and one that drops the board gate.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-2954.test.js
