 * Memory-equivalence test for enterAttractMode (ROM 0x1475) — "reset into attract
 * mode": flip-screen latch 0x7D82 := 1, GAME_STATE (0x6005) := 1, ATTRACT (0x6007)
 * := 1, GAME_SUBSTATE (0x600A) := 0.
 *
 * This is the CYCLE-FREE / memory-equivalence gate (docs/06), not the retired strict
 * whole-machine one. enterAttractMode WRITES RAM, so every case uses a FRESH clone
 * per side (never a reused machine). The oracle runs on one clone, enterAttractMode
 * on another, and they are compared on the go-forward contract:
 *
 *     RAM (dumpState, minus STACK_SCRATCH) + declared live-out (none).
 *
 * NEITHER pc NOR SP is compared, and both exclusions are honest live-out, not a
 * dodge. The oracle's terminal step is `m.ret`, which pops the return address (SP+2)
 * AND sets pc to it via step(); the direct-call layer replaces that whole stack ABI
 * with a JS return, so enterAttractMode leaves pc and SP at entry. Both are dead —
 * the game-state dispatcher reloads its own context each vblank and reads no register
 * or flag this routine leaves. (This differs from silenceSound/0x011c, whose oracle
 * ends with pop16+tick and so *could* compare pc; loc_1475's `m.ret` mutates pc, so
 * here pc is dead ABI too.)
 *
 * loc_1475 reads NOTHING (no memory, no register), so its behaviour is a constant
 * independent of the entry state — the same shape as silenceSound. Its own dispatch
 * site is NOT reached in a plain attract run (loc_141e's neither-found fall-through
 * never fires there), so realistic full-machine entries are sourced at a hot
 * REACHABLE dispatch (rst 0x18 / 0x0018) and enterAttractMode is run on each; that is
 * valid precisely because the routine ignores its input. Jobs:
 *
 *   1. EQUAL (captured states) — real machine states captured at rst 0x18; on each,
 *      oracle vs enterAttractMode leave identical RAM (−STACK_SCRATCH).
 *   2. WRITE-SET (crafted) — on a pre-dirtied entry the oracle's ONLY work-RAM writes
 *      are exactly 0x6005:=1, 0x6007:=1, 0x600A:=0. Documents the diffed footprint
 *      (0x7D82 is a write-only board output, outside the RAM dump).
 *   3. CRAFTED (overwrite dirty RAM) — pre-dirty 0x6005/0x6007/0x600A to 0x77 on BOTH
 *      sides and confirm both drive them to 1/1/0, RAM identical. Proves the set-
 *      semantics (input-independence), not mere agreement on already-matching RAM.
 *   4. TEETH — two broken twins the gate MUST catch: (a) wrong GAME_STATE constant
 *      (=2), caught by RAM on every state; (b) skips clearing GAME_SUBSTATE, caught on
 *      any state whose 0x600A != 0 (the captured and the crafted-dirtied entries).
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-1475.test.js
