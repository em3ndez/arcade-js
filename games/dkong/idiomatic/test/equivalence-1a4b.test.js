/**
 * Equivalence test for armEdgeRivetPickup (ROM 0x1a4b) — the "arm the edge-item pickup"
 * store. arm_1a4b raises EDGE_RIVET_ARMED (0x6291) = 1 unconditionally and returns; it
 * is a LEAF that reads NOTHING, calls nothing, and writes exactly one byte. Because it
 * reads nothing, its output is a constant store — a total function with no live input —
 * so it is gated the strongest way such a routine can be: swept EXHAUSTIVELY over all
 * 256 PRIOR values of the target byte (proving the store is unconditional, independent
 * of what was there), on a real captured attract machine, compared on RAM (minus
 * STACK_SCRATCH) + pc + SP. Every case runs on a FRESH clone (the routine WRITES memory).
 *
 * Live-out is memory-only (0x6291 := 1): the sole exit successor (loc_197a's next call,
 * sub_2a85) overwrites A with `ld a,(0x6215)` before reading it, so the oracle's residual
 * A == 1 is dead ABI and the register file is deliberately NOT compared.
 *
 *   0. REACHABILITY — attract never dispatches 0x1a4b (the player never stands on an
 *      exact screen-edge column MARIO_X 0x4B/0xB3, the only way here). Asserted at 0,
 *      which is exactly why the gate is crafted-entry rather than real-dispatch. The
 *      SAME host run captures a real mid-attract machine at the first sub_1a33 dispatch
 *      (0x1a33, the caller — reached ~1478x on 25m attract) as the realistic base: its
 *      SP already holds loc_197a's real return address, so the `ret` lands correctly.
 *
 *   1. EQUAL (exhaustive) — sweep all 256 prior values of 0x6291, each staged on the
 *      real base, and confirm armEdgeRivetPickup == oracle on RAM−STACK_SCRATCH + pc +
 *      SP, and that 0x6291 ends 1 in every case. 256 cases cover the whole (only) input
 *      the routine could conceivably read — it reads none, so all end identically.
 *
 *   2. FOOTPRINT — the oracle writes exactly ONE non-stack byte, 0x6291; nothing else.
 *      This licenses the "touches only 0x6291" claim in the routine header.
 *
 *   3. TEETH — three deliberately-broken twins, each MUST be caught:
 *      (a) wrong-VALUE twin (stores 0x00 instead of 0x01) — caught by the RAM diff at
 *          0x6291 (the flag would never arm);
 *      (b) wrong-ADDRESS twin (stores 1 to 0x6290 = RIVETS_LEFT instead of 0x6291) —
 *          caught by the RAM diff (corrupts the rivet count, leaves the flag unarmed);
 *      (c) extra-stack-pop twin (a leaked pop the direct-call routine must NOT do) —
 *          caught by the SP diff on every case.
 *
 * The idiomatic routine models the Z80 `ret` as a JS return (no stack modelling), so the
 * harness performs one m.ret() on the candidate clone AFTER the call to line pc + SP up
 * with the oracle (which rets internally). The oracle only READS the stack (the ret pop),
 * never writes it, so RAM is byte-equal on both sides regardless.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-1a4b.test.js
