/**
 * Equivalence test for awardScorePopup (ROM 0x1E28) — the score-award + popup-glyph
 * routine (post a score task, stage the number sprite at Mario, ping the sound).
 *
 * awardScorePopup WRITES memory (the task ring + tail, the four POPUP_SPRITE bytes at
 * 0x6A30, and conditionally SND_TRIGGER[5]) and CALLS two subroutines (enqueueTask
 * 0x309F, boardBitGate 0x0030), so it is gated by capture / clone / replay (docs/decompiler-pipeline),
 * NOT the exhaustive-leaf pattern. A FRESH clone is used per case because the routine
 * mutates RAM. The oracle models the Z80 stack (`push … call … rst … ret`, moving
 * SP/pc); the idiomatic version uses the JS call stack and models neither, so the only
 * tolerated residue is the pushed return-address bytes inside dead STACK_SCRATCH —
 * every game-visible byte must match.
 *
 *   1. EQUAL (real captured dispatches) — hook 0x1E28 in a real attract run and clone
 *      the machine at each true dispatch. Attract reaches it on 25m as a barrel-jump
 *      award (BOARD==1, E=1, B=0x7B: the gate-OPEN / sound arm). For each, run the
 *      ORACLE and awardScorePopup on independent clones and confirm identical RAM
 *      everywhere game-visible (diff confined to STACK_SCRATCH), and that the idiomatic
 *      version leaves SP/pc at their entry values (no stack modelling).
 *
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted arms) — attract only exercises one tier on one board, so the arms
 *      it never reaches are forced by poking a real entry IDENTICALLY on both sides
 *      (the crafted entry, docs/decompiler-pipeline): the other two score tiers (E=3/B=0x7D, E=5/B=0x7F)
 *      and every board — BOARD 2 and 4 CLOSE the `rst 0x30` gate (no sound), BOARD 3
 *      OPENS it (sound). The test asserts the gate actually branched both ways (oracle
 *      SND_TRIGGER[5] == 3 open vs 0 closed), so the conditional is proven non-vacuous.
 *
 *   3. TEETH — two deliberately-broken twins the gate MUST catch:
 *        (a) the popup Y written without the +0x14 below-Mario offset — a plausible
 *            dropped-constant bug, caught at 0x6A33 on the real captured dispatch;
 *        (b) the award sound written UNCONDITIONALLY (ignoring the board gate) — caught
 *            at SND_TRIGGER[5] on a crafted gate-closed (BOARD 2) entry.
 *      A gate a real corruption slips through is worthless.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-1e28.test.js
