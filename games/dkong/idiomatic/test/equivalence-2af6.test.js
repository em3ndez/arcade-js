 * Equivalence test for loc_2af6 (ROM 0x2AF6) — pick the platform row's drift step by
 * Mario's X (0x63A5 for the far-right half, 0x63A4 for the left half), then advance Mario
 * with it via the shared X mover moveMarioX (0x2B02).
 *
 * loc_2af6 is one arm of the moving-platform row mover, reached only through sub_2ad3 on
 * the moving-platform boards (Y == 0x78 row). Attract never rides those rows, so there are
 * ZERO real 0x2AF6 dispatches in a long attract run (see REACHABILITY); coverage is
 * therefore CRAFTED on a real attract base. The routine's whole memory-observable behaviour
 * is a total function of:
 *   - the prior X in regs.b, which selects the shadow cell (>= 0x80 -> 0x63A5, else 0x63A4);
 *   - the step byte held in the selected shadow cell, handed to moveMarioX as the velocity.
 * so a sweep over all 256 prior-X values (covering both selector halves and the X==0x80
 * boundary) with DISTINCT 0x63A4/0x63A5 steps drives both arms and, through the mover, every
 * position-gate verdict (crossed with board parity and Y band).
 *
 * DISSOLVED CALL / STACK: the oracle tail-jumps into move_2b02 (`jp 0x2b02`, no push), and
 * move_2b02's own `ret` returns on loc_2af6's behalf — so the oracle chain nets exactly ONE
 * caller-return pop. The idiomatic routine models no stack (a direct moveMarioX call, whose
 * idiomatic body does not `ret`), so runCandidate performs ONE m.ret() after it to line pc +
 * SP up with the oracle, and the RAM diff excludes the dead STACK_SCRATCH [0x6be0,0x6c00) the
 * oracle's downstream push writes. With no overrides the oracle's m.call chain (move_2b02 ->
 * sub_241f) resolves to the translated routines, so its stack accounting is self-contained.
 *
 *   1. REACHABILITY — 0x2AF6 is NOT dispatched during attract (documents why the gate is
 *      crafted; if this ever becomes nonzero, add captured coverage).
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted sweep) — loc_2af6 == oracle over the full 256 x 2 x 2 space
 *      (RAM - STACK_SCRATCH, pc, SP).
 *   3. TEETH — three broken twins, each MUST be caught:
 *      (a) inverted boundary (`< 0x80`)  -> wrong cell on both halves -> MARIO_X diverges.
 *      (b) off-by-one boundary (`> 0x80`) -> wrong cell only at prior X == 0x80.
 *      (c) dropped selection (always 0x63A4) -> wrong cell on the far-right half.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-2af6.test.js
