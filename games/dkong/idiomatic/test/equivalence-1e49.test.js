 * Equivalence test for loc_1e49 (ROM 0x1e49) — the idle (do-nothing) arm of
 * sub_1dbd's rst-0x28 router on the state byte 0x6340. It is a single-byte `ret`:
 * it reads and writes NO memory and leaves NO live registers (sub_1dbd -> loc_197a
 * @0x197D reads nothing on return, it just proceeds to the next call), so live-out
 * is memory-only — in fact empty. It is gated on memory-equivalence over RAM (minus
 * STACK_SCRATCH) + pc + SP, and every case runs on a FRESH clone:
 *
 *   1. EQUAL (real captured dispatches) — hook 0x1e49 in a real attract run and clone
 *      the machine at each true dispatch. Attract reaches it hundreds of times from
 *      sub_1dbd while 0x6340 == 0 (entry SP 0x6bea-0x6bee, all inside STACK_SCRATCH).
 *      For each capture: (a) confirm the ORACLE itself writes NO RAM (the "does
 *      nothing" claim, direct), and (b) confirm loc_1e49 == oracle on
 *      RAM-STACK_SCRATCH + pc + SP.
 *
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted entry) — the routine is branchless, so there are no unreached
 *      ARMS; instead the craft exercises a state the natural run never produces: SP
 *      pointed into ordinary work RAM (0x6100) with a return address staged there, so
 *      the popped bytes land in the COMPARED region rather than the dead stack. This
 *      proves the `ret`'s pop is READ-ONLY even there (no clobber of the return slot),
 *      identically both sides.
 *
 *   3. TEETH — two deliberately-broken twins, each MUST be caught:
 *      (a) a stray-write twin (advances 0x6340 to 2, i.e. does entry 1's work by
 *          mistake) — caught by the RAM diff on every case;
 *      (b) an extra-stack-pop twin (a leaked stack-pop the idiomatic routine must NOT
 *          do) — caught by the SP (and usually pc) diff on every case.
 *
 * The idiomatic routine models the Z80 `ret` as a JS return (no stack modelling), so
 * the harness performs one m.ret() on the candidate clone AFTER the call to line pc +
 * SP up with the oracle (which rets internally). The oracle only READS the stack (the
 * ret pop), never writes it, so RAM is byte-equal on both sides regardless.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-1e49.test.js
