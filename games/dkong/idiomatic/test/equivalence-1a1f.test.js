/**
 * Equivalence test for advanceBonusExpiredStepWhenDelayExpires (ROM 0x1a1f) — the
 * state-2 (DELAY) handler of the bonus-expired sequence.
 *
 * loc_1a1f's entire observable behaviour is a function of ONE byte, BONUS_EXPIRED_DELAY
 * (0x6387): it decrements it in place and, only when the result is 0, writes the constant
 * 3 to BONUS_EXPIRED_STEP (0x6386). It reads no other memory (0x6386 is written, never
 * read) and calls nothing. It returns nothing its dispatcher consumes — entry_1a07's idx2
 * arm returns a constant true and control lands in loc_197a, which reads no register the
 * handler leaves behind. Everything else the oracle touches (SP via `ret`, PC via the
 * step model, the residual A/HL/F) is the Z80 return mechanism the direct-call model
 * drops; the `ret` only reads (pops) the stack, so nothing lands outside the contract,
 * which is therefore RAM (minus STACK_SCRATCH). That admits the strongest gate available:
 *
 *   1. EQUAL (exhaustive) — advanceBonusExpiredStepWhenDelayExpires == oracle over ALL
 *      256 values of BONUS_EXPIRED_DELAY, compared on RAM (minus STACK_SCRATCH). 0x6386 is
 *      seeded to a non-3 sentinel so the advance-to-3 is an observable RAM change (the
 *      routine never reads it, so this cannot affect the branch). 256 is the complete
 *      input space — a proof, not a sample.
 *
 *   2. TEETH (exhaustive) — two deliberately-broken twins the sweep MUST catch:
 *        (a) advance-always — advances BONUS_EXPIRED_STEP to 3 every frame, ignoring the
 *            `ret nz` guard. Ticks 0x6387 like the oracle, so only 0x6386 diverges, and
 *            only where remaining != 0 (255 of 256 inputs) — proving the sweep both
 *            reaches that edge and sees the wrong advance.
 *        (b) no-decrement — writes 0x6387 back unchanged (advancing when the ORIGINAL
 *            byte was 0). Diverges at 0x6387 vs the oracle's decrement — proving the
 *            sweep sees a wrong count.
 *
 *   3. CRAFTED REALISM — loc_1a1f is never dispatched in attract (BONUS never expires
 *      there), so its dispatcher 0x1A07 is captured from a real attract run (it fires
 *      916×/1500 frames, always at step 0) and each captured machine is nudged into
 *      state 2 — 0x6386 := 2 with a spread of 0x6387 values — IDENTICALLY on both sides,
 *      confirming the candidate reproduces the oracle's RAM on realistic surrounding RAM.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-1a1f.test.js
