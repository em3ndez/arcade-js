/**
 * Equivalence test for seed25mBoardObjects (ROM 0x0FD7) — the 25m board's initial
 * object-record + sprite-shadow setup (entry 1 of the 0x0FCD per-board dispatch
 * table). A straight-line orchestrator over two inline `ldir`s and four callee calls
 * (replicateGroupStrided ×3, loc_11fa, seedSpriteObjectPair).
 *
 * loc_0fd7 WRITES memory across pages 0x64/0x66/0x67/0x68/0x69/0x6A and reads only
 * ROM constants (all its sources are < 0x4000; the only RAM it reads are object
 * records it wrote itself, inside seedSpriteObjectPair). So it is validated by
 * capture/clone/replay on a FRESH clone per case — never by reusing one machine, and
 * never on the full register file, cycles, SP or PC. The contract compared is RAM
 * (minus STACK_SCRATCH) only: LIVE-OUT is memory-only (the `ret` returns to a `call`
 * that reads no register this routine leaves — see the routine header).
 *
 *   1. REALISM — hook 0x0FD7 in a real attract run and clone the machine at each real
 *      dispatch. Attract plays 25m, so its board build dispatches this routine. For
 *      each capture, run oracle vs seed25mBoardObjects on two fresh clones and confirm
 *      identical RAM (ex-stack).
 *
 *   2. CRAFTED — the routine's inputs are fixed ROM constants (a real dispatch already
 *      exercises every write), so the crafted cases harden the gate instead of reaching
 *      new arms: sentinel-fill the entire destination footprint (0x6400–0x6AFF) FIRST,
 *      identically on both sides, so any short, missing, or mis-placed write surfaces as
 *      a sentinel-vs-written mismatch. Both 0xA5 and 0x00 sentinels.
 *
 *   3. TEETH — a twin that breaks step 7's one subtlety: instead of reusing step 6's
 *      preserved source (0x101B) and stride (C=0x1C), it reloads a different source and
 *      stride. That mis-fills the 0x68 records and MUST be caught — on the real capture
 *      (0x6807 differs) and on a prefilled craft.
 *
 * NOT COMPARED, deliberately: SP, PC, cycles, and the full register file (docs/decompiler-pipeline). The
 * oracle's `ret` and internal `call`s move SP/PC and the cycle counter; the idiomatic
 * layer drops that model (the JS call stack replaces it). The oracle's stack pushes land
 * only in STACK_SCRATCH, which the RAM diff skips.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-0fd7.test.js
