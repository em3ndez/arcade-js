/**
 * Memory-equivalence test for stampRivetBoardBands (ROM 0x0D43) — "stamp the two-band
 * tile motif into two fixed tilemap rows during 100m-rivet (board 4) setup". It runs
 * the shared filler stampTwoTileBands (ROM 0x0D4C) twice: HL=0x7687 then HL=0x7547.
 * Each pass writes 0xFD across four cells (base..base+3), skips a 28-cell gap
 * (DE=0x001C), then writes 0xFC across four cells (base+0x20..base+0x23) — sixteen
 * video-RAM writes in all (eight per row).
 *
 * This is the CYCLE-FREE / memory-equivalence gate (docs/decompiler-pipeline), not the retired strict
 * whole-machine one. The routine WRITES video RAM, so every case uses a FRESH clone per
 * side. The ORACLE (translated/sub_0d43, which reaches its filler through m.call) runs
 * on one clone, stampRivetBoardBands (which calls the decompiled stampTwoTileBands
 * directly) on another, and they are compared on the go-forward contract:
 *
 *     RAM (dumpState, minus STACK_SCRATCH) only.
 *
 * pc and SP are deliberately NOT compared. The oracle uses push16/m.step/m.ret, so it
 * advances pc and its callees pop SP; both are the modelled step/stack ABI the direct-
 * call layer replaces with a JS return. STACK_SCRATCH is masked because the oracle's
 * `push16(0x0d49)` writes a dead return address there that the direct-call candidate
 * never writes — a benign, non-propagating difference in dead scratch. Memory (the
 * sixteen video-RAM cells) is the only live-out: the caller loc_0c92 does `ld hl,0x7d86`
 * right after the call (overwriting HL before reading it), B/DE are reloaded and no flag
 * is tested, so HL/B/DE and all flags are dead.
 *
 * REACHABILITY. stampRivetBoardBands is board-4-only (100m rivet setup: loc_0c92's
 * board-4 arm at 0x0CB6 does `call 0x0d43`) and attract only plays 25m, so it NEVER
 * dispatches in a plain run. Following the sibling gates (0x0D4C / 0x0D00), the test
 * forces the real dispatch with an IDENTICAL-BOTH-SIDES board poke (Karl-sanctioned
 * "poke the board state to reach a state for validation"): at frame 100 set
 * GAME_STATE=3, GAME_SUBSTATE=10 (board setup), SUBSTATE_TIMER=1, BOARD=4 (100m rivet).
 * sub_0d43 then fires under the vblank NMI (~frame 102) — a REAL captured entry (real
 * register file, real stack, real board).
 *
 * Jobs:
 *   1. EQUAL (real forced dispatch) — oracle vs stampRivetBoardBands on fresh clones of
 *      each captured entry leave identical RAM (−STACK_SCRATCH); the candidate is read
 *      back to confirm it genuinely stamped both rows.
 *   2. WRITE-SET (captured) — the oracle's writes are EXACTLY the sixteen tilemap cells
 *      (0xFD/0xFC bands at 0x7687 and 0x7547); every other changed byte lies in the dead
 *      STACK_SCRATCH region (the push16). Documents the full footprint.
 *   3. CRAFTED (overwrite) — pre-dirty the sixteen destination cells to 0xAA identically
 *      both sides; both overwrite them and RAM stays identical.
 *   4. CRAFTED (input-independence) — garbage in HL/B/C/D/E/A and a far RAM byte,
 *      identically both sides, does not change the output — the two bases are internal
 *      ROM immediates, so HL on entry is irrelevant (the routine reloads it).
 *   5. TEETH — a twin with a WRONG second row base (0x7647 instead of 0x7547, a plausible
 *      off-by-0x100 slip) drops the second row's bands onto the wrong cells and MUST be
 *      caught; on a pre-dirtied crafted state the first divergence is named at 0x7547.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-0d43.test.js
