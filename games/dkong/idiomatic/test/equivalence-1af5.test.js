/**
 * Memory-equivalence test for walkLeftWhileHeld (ROM 0x1AF5) — the LEFT arm of Mario's ground-movement
 * direction dispatch: walk him one frame left when the control word says Left is held AND the
 * horizontal position gate's left verdict is not blocking, otherwise fall through to the
 * ladder/climb collision handler.
 *
 * The routine writes no memory of its own — everything observable is written by the callee it
 * picks — so what is really being gated is the BRANCH. Both arms end by tailing into a callee
 * whose chain nets exactly one caller-return, so the harness performs ONE m.ret() on the
 * candidate to line pc + SP up with the oracle (the same pattern as equivalence-1cab and
 * equivalence-1afe). The contract is RAM − STACK_SCRATCH + pc + SP + the return value; no
 * register file, because the live-out is memory-only plus that return (see the routine header).
 * Real dispatches sit at SP 0x6BEA..0x6BEE, so all the dissolved call/return churn stays inside
 * STACK_SCRATCH.
 *
 *   1. REACHABILITY — hook 0x1AF5 in a real attract run and classify EVERY dispatch (not just
 *      the cloned ones). The walk-left and fall-through arms both occur in quantity — 1422
 *      dispatches over the 9000 frames this test runs, split 745 walk-left / 677 fall-through when
 *      last measured; the test classifies and prints them rather than asserting those numbers. The
 *      BLOCKED arm (left verdict == 1) occurs ZERO times, because attract keeps Mario where the
 *      position gate answers 0 — the left-limit flag is 0 on every single one of those dispatches.
 *      The test asserts that zero explicitly rather than leaving it implied: crafted entries are
 *      the only thing covering that arm.
 *
 *   2. EQUAL (real dispatches) — replay every cloned attract dispatch, oracle vs candidate.
 *
 *   3. EQUAL (crafted, exhaustive over the decision surface) — the routine's whole decision is
 *      (left verdict == 1, control word bit 1), so the sweep is exhaustive: all 256 control
 *      words against left verdicts 0, 1, 2 and 255, seeded from a real captured dispatch so the
 *      surrounding RAM and stack are in-distribution. Non-vacuity is asserted separately: on the
 *      seed, the walk arm and the blocked arm really do leave different RAM, and the walk arm
 *      really does move Mario.
 *
 *   4. TEETH — four deliberately-broken twins, each of which the contract MUST catch. Two are
 *      exactly the constants that separate this arm from its 0x1AE6 mirror, so a green run means
 *      the direction is pinned and not merely plausible:
 *        (a) dropped left-limit gate — walks left even when the position gate blocks it.
 *        (b) inverted left-limit gate — walks left ONLY when blocked.
 *        (c) the mirror's input bit — tests bit 0 (Right) instead of bit 1 (Left).
 *        (d) the mirror's stepper — calls walkMarioRight instead of walkMarioLeft.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-1af5.test.js
