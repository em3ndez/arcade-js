 * Equivalence test for stageAward500Popup (ROM 0x1E08) — the middle of the three effect setters:
 * stage B = 0x7E, DE = 0x0005, then tail-jump into the shared handler stageAwardPopupAtHitObject.
 *
 * stageAward500Popup WRITES memory (through stageAwardPopupAtHitObject: the task ring via enqueueTask, the block[0]
 * clear at *(0x6343), and — via stampScorePopupSprite — the sprite record 0x6A30..0x6A33 + the gated
 * sound 0x6085) and is NOT a leaf, so it is gated by capture / clone / replay (docs/decompiler-pipeline)
 * with a FRESH clone per case. Its own body is two register loads and a delegate; every
 * branch lives in its callees (enqueueTask's full-ring drop, stampScorePopupSprite's board gate).
 *
 * Attract NEVER dispatches stageAward500Popup — its callers armScorePopupAndSelectAward / pickRandomAwardTier are level-2+ paths
 * the 25m demo doesn't take (confirmed: attract's only 0x1e15 dispatches arrive via the
 * sibling stageAward300Popup, B=0x7D). So there is no "real stageAward500Popup dispatch" to capture. Instead
 * we capture REAL stageAwardPopupAtHitObject entry states — the exact live-in a `jp 0x1e15` lands in — and
 * run the oracle vs idiomatic stageAward500Popup on each. Because stageAward500Popup's ENTIRE contribution is
 * to overwrite B and DE with fixed constants (identically on both sides), a real stageAwardPopupAtHitObject
 * entry is a faithful crafted base for stageAward500Popup: both sides start the chain from the exact
 * same (B=0x7E, DE=0x0005) over a real ring / param block / board state.
 *
 *   1. REALISM (crafted base) — on each real captured 25m entry, oracle vs idiomatic
 *      stageAward500Popup leave byte-identical game-visible RAM (residual confined to STACK_SCRATCH:
 *      the oracle models `jp`/`call`/`ret`, so its SP/pc move; idiomatic uses the JS call
 *      stack and models neither). The oracle's deepest push (SP-4) must sit inside
 *      STACK_SCRATCH for the exclusion to be sound; idiomatic must leave SP/pc unchanged.
 *
 *   2. BOARD (exhaustive crafted) — stampScorePopupSprite's gate is the chain's only board-dependent
 *      logic and attract exercises only BOARD 1, so poke BOARD to every byte 0..255
 *      identically on both sides. This pins the 50m/100m CLOSED arms (no 0x6085 write).
 *
 *   3. PARAM BLOCK (edge crafted) — poke the four block bytes at *(0x6343) to distinct
 *      edge tuples on both sides, pinning the inherited block[0]->A (0x6A30), block[3]->C
 *      (0x6A33), and the byte-0 CLEAR — none of which stageAward500Popup changes, but all of which
 *      it must faithfully carry through.
 *
 *   4. DROP arm (crafted) — occupy the ring slot at the tail so enqueueTask silently drops
 *      (bit7 clear), exercising the composition on the drop path; the tail must stay put.
 *
 *   5. TEETH — two twins on stageAward500Popup's OWN constants (what distinguishes it from its
 *      siblings), each on a real write-arm base the whole-RAM replay MUST catch:
 *        (a) wrong B constant (0x7D instead of 0x7E) — caught at record byte 0x6A31.
 *        (b) wrong DE constant (0x0003 instead of 0x0005) — caught at the ring argument
 *            slot (the E byte at tail+1), proving the queued message value matters.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-1e08.test.js
