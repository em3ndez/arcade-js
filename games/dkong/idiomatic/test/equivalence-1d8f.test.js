 * Memory-equivalence test for triggerWalkSound (ROM 0x1d8f) — "request the walk
 * (footstep) sound": store 3 into SND_TRIGGER[0] (0x6080), a 3-frame hold that the
 * per-vblank sound driver counts down onto ls259.6h bit 0 (hardware latch 0x7D00).
 *
 * This is the CYCLE-FREE / memory-equivalence gate (docs/decompiler-pipeline), not the retired strict
 * whole-machine one. triggerWalkSound WRITES RAM, so every captured case uses a FRESH
 * clone per side (never a reused machine). The oracle runs on one clone, the rewrite
 * on another, and they are compared on the go-forward contract:
 *
 *     RAM (dumpState, minus STACK_SCRATCH) + declared live-out (none).
 *
 * pc and SP are deliberately NOT compared. sub_1d8f's oracle models its terminal
 * `ret` with m.step/m.ret — advancing pc to the popped return address and SP by +2 —
 * which is exactly the stack/PC ABI the direct-call layer replaces with a JS return;
 * comparing either would test the stack model we drop, not the routine. (Contrast
 * silenceSound at 0x011c, whose oracle uses tick/pop16 and leaves pc at entry, so it
 * could keep pc; this oracle steps, so pc is a ret artifact here.) The routine reads
 * nothing and leaves no live register, so the memory footprint IS the whole contract.
 *
 * Jobs:
 *   1. EQUAL (captured dispatches) — hook 0x1d8f in a real attract run; on each true
 *      25m dispatch, oracle vs triggerWalkSound leave identical RAM (−STACK_SCRATCH).
 *   2. WRITE-SET (captured) — the oracle's ONLY work-RAM write is the single byte
 *      SND_TRIGGER[0] (0x6080) := 3. Documents the exact footprint the gate covers.
 *   3. CRAFTED (overwrites prior contents) — the routine is input-independent and
 *      straight-line (no unreached arms), so the meaningful crafted case is prior
 *      contents: pre-dirty 0x6080 to 0xAA identically on both sides and confirm both
 *      land 3. Proves the store-semantics, not mere agreement on an already-3 byte.
 *   4. TEETH — a twin that writes the WRONG frame count (0x02 instead of 0x03) to
 *      SND_TRIGGER[0] MUST be caught, on every captured state and the crafted one.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-1d8f.test.js
