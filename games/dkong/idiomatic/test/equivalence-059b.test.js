 * Equivalence test for loc_059b (ROM 0x059B) — the score-RESET task. It selects one of the
 * three on-screen score counters from the task payload, ZEROES its 3 bytes, then repaints
 * it (now 000000) by handing off to drawScoreTask (0x05C6):
 *   • payload 0 -> player 1's counter (P1_SCORE) up column 0x7781,
 *   • payload 1 (or any other value below 3) -> player 2's counter (P2_SCORE) up 0x7521,
 *   • payload 2 -> the high score (HIGH_SCORE) up its fixed column 0x7641,
 *   • payload 3 and up -> the un-lifted recursive-clear arm at ROM 0x05BD, which BOTH
 *     sides surface as a fault.
 *
 * loc_059b is the clear-first twin of drawScoreTask. The oracle preserves the payload
 * across the clear with a balanced push/pop, then tail-jumps into the renderer chain,
 * whose final `ret` pops the task's caller-return — the ONE net stack change on every
 * render path; that push/pop and the renderer's per-digit push16/pop touch only bytes
 * inside STACK_SCRATCH, excluded by the contract. The idiomatic routine models no stack
 * (a plain JS return + a direct drawScoreTask call), so the harness performs one m.ret()
 * on the candidate clone AFTER the call to line pc + SP up with the oracle. So it is gated
 * on MEMORY-EQUIVALENCE — RAM − STACK_SCRATCH + pc + SP — not a returned scalar, and every
 * case runs on a FRESH clone. LIVE-OUT is memory-only (the task returns to the main loop,
 * which reloads its registers), so the register file is not compared.
 *
 * GROUNDING — loc_059b is the score RESET, not the per-frame redraw, so it NEVER dispatches
 * in attract; it fires when a credited game starts. The canonical coin+start tape drives
 * exactly one real dispatch (payload 0 -> P1_SCORE, at game start), which grounds the
 * player-1 arm; crafted entries then pin what the tape does not vary:
 *   1. EQUAL (real)    — the real captured game-start dispatch reproduced exactly, and the
 *                        player-1 counter left zeroed.
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted) — the player-2 arm (payload 1) and the high-score arm (payload 2),
 *                        seeded from real attract RAM with three distinct counters, identical
 *                        on both sides; each case proves the SELECTED counter was zeroed, the
 *                        OTHER two left intact, and the selected column repainted to 0.
 *   3. FAULT           — payload 3 AND a higher payload (0x80) throw on both sides (proving
 *                        the arm is payload>=3, not just ==3), writing no non-stack RAM.
 *   4. TEETH           — two twins the gate MUST catch: (a) SWAPS the player-1/player-2 clear
 *                        target, so the wrong counter is zeroed; (b) lands a NONZERO byte in
 *                        the clear, so the counter is not fully reset.
