/**
 * Equivalence gate for loc_20c3 (ROM 0x20C3) — reflect an object record's vertical arc, store a
 * QUARTER of the reflection back as the arc's new launch speed (+0x12/+0x13), clear the elapsed
 * frame counter (+0x14) and both coordinate fractions (+0x04/+0x06), then jump to the shared
 * object-sprite tail at ROM 0x21BA. That tail, the object loop behind it and its return are the
 * FROZEN ORACLE on both sides here and are not under test; what this gate has to prove is the
 * five writes, the exact arithmetic that produces the two stored halves, and that the tail's
 * result is handed back.
 *
 *   0. REACHABILITY — how many real 0x20C3 dispatches a 4000-frame attract run produces, on which
 *      records, and through which of the four callers. The caller identity is MEASURED, by hooking
 *      ROM 0x2083 / 0x20A2 / 0x20B5 / 0x20E1 with their own frozen oracles in the same run, not
 *      inferred from the entry state.
 *
 *   1. EQUAL (captured) — EVERY captured dispatch is replayed, not a sample: the run produces 49,
 *      far below the point where sampling would be worth its coverage risk. Each is replayed on
 *      two byte-identical clones — oracle on one, loc_20c3 on the other — and compared on
 *      RAM − STACK_SCRATCH, the RETURN VALUE, and the register file. This test ALSO produces the
 *      coverage holes the routine's GATE: line quotes, as assertions rather than prose: attract
 *      never delivers a reflection with the high bit set, never one with either low bit set, and
 *      never a stored high byte other than 0 — so on its own this arm cannot distinguish a
 *      sign-preserving shift, a rounded shift, or a hard-zeroed high byte. Arm 2 is what does.
 *
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted) — all 256 elapsed-frame counts × 16 launch speeds, poked identically onto
 *      both sides of a REAL capture of each distinct entry shape. The speeds are chosen to drive
 *      the three holes above, and the test ASSERTS that they did (a reflection past the sign
 *      boundary, reflections with low bits to discard, and stored high bytes that are not 0), so
 *      the sweep cannot silently stop covering what it claims to cover.
 *
 *   3. LIVE-WIRE — loc_20c3 drives a whole 4000-frame attract run as a registered override, and
 *      every frame of the state trace must match the PURE all-oracle baseline. Nothing else is
 *      wired: the baseline is the frozen game, so this arm measures the composition of this
 *      routine with the already-idiomatic loc_2407 it direct-calls against the untouched ROM.
 *      Unusually, the comparison here includes STACK_SCRATCH — the unit arms must exclude it
 *      (dissolving the oracle's call bracket around ROM 0x2407 leaves a real difference at
 *      0x6BEA mid-routine), but the trace is sampled at frame boundaries, by which point both
 *      sides have overwritten that residue identically. THE CYCLE RESTORATION IS NOT COSMETIC:
 *      Donkey Kong seeds entropy from timing, and the CONTROL arm wires the same rewrite without
 *      it and asserts the trace DOES fork — measured at frame 966, on SPIN_COUNT, which is the
 *      very first dispatch. The head cost is measured, not assumed: the oracle is run on a
 *      throwaway clone with the tail STUBBED (and the stub proven live by a counter), so only the
 *      fragment this routine replaces is priced — the tail is not, because the rewrite still runs
 *      it and charges it itself.
 *
 *   4. TEETH — eight broken twins, each annotated with the arm that MUST catch it, and the
 *      annotation is ASSERTED both ways: a twin marked invisible to the captured arm fails the
 *      test if that arm catches it after all, so the coverage holes above cannot rot silently.
 *        (a) sign-preserving shift  — INVISIBLE to arms 1 and 3 (attract produces no reflection
 *                                     past the sign boundary); caught only by arm 2.
 *        (b) rounded shift          — INVISIBLE to arms 1 and 3 (attract's reflections are all
 *                                     exact multiples of 4); caught only by arm 2.
 *        (c) hard-zero high byte    — INVISIBLE to arm 1 (the stored high byte is 0 on all 49);
 *                                     caught only by arm 2.
 *        (d) swapped halves         — caught by arm 1.
 *        (e) no counter reset       — caught by arm 1.
 *        (f) no X-fraction clear    — caught by arm 1.
 *        (g) dropped register mirror— identical RAM and identical return; caught ONLY by the
 *                                     register comparison, on 10 of the 49 captures.
 *        (h) swallowed tail result  — identical RAM, wrong result. INVISIBLE to the RAM diff, and
 *                                     `false` from an address that is not in machine.js's
 *                                     SEAM_CALLER_SKIP makes the seam consume a stack word the
 *                                     routine does not owe.
 *
 *   5. BEHAVIOUR — the reading the routine's header rests on, checked against the ORACLE's own
 *      attract run rather than a scratchpad: across the captured dispatches the object's vertical
 *      step must reverse sign (or already be at rest), and its magnitude must be SMALLER after
 *      than before. A re-launch, a position edit, or an undamped reflection would each fail this.
 *
 *   6. THE ONE REGISTER EXCLUSION, PINNED. The register comparison excludes exactly two fields,
 *      the alternate B and C. They differ because the FROZEN ROM 0x2407 loads the record's
 *      +0x12/+0x13 operand into that pair while the already-idiomatic loc_2407 — whose own gate
 *      declares every register but the returned pair dead — does not. This test asserts that
 *      characterisation rather than assuming it: wherever the pair differs, the oracle's value
 *      must equal those two record bytes as they stood at entry. If that ever stops holding, the
 *      exclusion is hiding something else and this test says so.
 *
 * COVERAGE THIS DOES NOT CLAIM: attract only, plus pokes on top of attract state. No credited
 * game, no board other than 25m. The crafted sweep varies only the three bytes the routine reads;
 * record bases other than the seven attract walks are not covered.
 *
 * Isolated replays use clone(), whose frame machinery is neutralised (nextNmi / nextBoundary =
 * Infinity), so an m.step inside the oracle cannot trip a live NMI whose handler would write RAM
 * and masquerade as an oracle side effect. The four caller hooks are their own FROZEN oracles,
 * delegating unchanged — they are a label on each capture, not a substitution, so the capture run
 * is the oracle's own run. That is deliberate for ROM 0x20E1 in particular, which HAS an idiomatic
 * file now (written alongside this one, and not yet in ROUTINES): hooking its oracle keeps the
 * capture run the frozen game rather than a half-flipped one. The capturing hook is LEFT INSTALLED on every clone but
 * stops recording once capture is done — the tail chain re-enters 0x20C3 on later slots of the
 * same object loop, so a hook that kept appending would grow the capture list underneath the
 * replay it is driving.
