/**
 * Equivalence test for loc_03fb (ROM 0x03FB) — the per-frame colour-cycle driver entry
 * with a 50m-only sprite-object row X-shift preamble in front of it.
 *
 * loc_03fb reads BOARD (0x6227) and routes two ways:
 *
 *   - BOARD != 2 (any board but 50m) -> serviceColorCycle (ROM 0x0413) directly.
 *   - BOARD == 2 (50m) -> the preamble, THEN serviceColorCycle:
 *       1. shift the X column of all ten sprite-object records (SPRITE_OBJ_BLOCK) by
 *          the 50m object-1 step (M50_OBJ1_STEP), via addToSpriteObjectColumn (rst 0x38);
 *       2. store ((the shifted third record's X byte at 0x6910) - 0x3b) into
 *          M50_OBJ_ROW_SHIFT (0x63B7).
 *
 * Its caller (loc_197a) `call`s it and the colour-cycle tail chain nets exactly ONE
 * caller-return pop down EVERY path — the rst-0x38 CALL on the BOARD == 2 arm pushes and
 * its callee pops (balanced), and both exits fall/jump into the loc_0413 colour chain
 * whose net `ret` returns on loc_03fb's behalf. The oracle only READS the stack past that
 * (the pushed bytes land in STACK_SCRATCH, excluded by the memory-equivalence contract).
 * The idiomatic routine models the Z80 stack as the JS call stack (direct calls, no
 * push16/ret of its own), so the harness performs ONE m.ret() on the candidate to line
 * pc + SP up with the oracle. A `new Machine(ROM)` with no overrides runs the pure
 * translated subtree for every m.call (oracle side is the frozen translated cascade); the
 * candidate side is the idiomatic cascade via direct imports. Every case runs on a FRESH
 * clone (the callees write memory).
 *
 *   1. REALISM (captured) — hook 0x03FB in a real attract run and confirm loc_03fb ==
 *      oracle over every natural dispatch. Attract plays 25m, so every real dispatch is
 *      BOARD == 1 (the colour-cycle hand-off); the BOARD == 2 preamble is COLD on tape.
 *
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted) — force the cold BOARD == 2 preamble (object-1 step +1 / -1 / 0,
 *      an 8-bit shift+subtract wrap) across the three colour-cycle routes (active /
 *      repaint / start-of-sweep), and the BOARD != 2 hand-off (boards 1/3/4) across the
 *      same routes, each over the whole contract (RAM - STACK_SCRATCH + pc + SP) plus a
 *      non-vacuity check on M50_OBJ_ROW_SHIFT (written on 50m, untouched otherwise).
 *
 *   3. TEETH — four deliberately-broken twins, each reusing the real idiomatic callees so
 *      the only divergence is the injected bug, each MUST be caught:
 *      (a) skipped preamble on 50m   — BOARD == 2 entry runs only the colour cycle; caught at 0x63B7.
 *      (b) preamble on the wrong board — BOARD == 1 entry runs the preamble; caught at 0x63B7.
 *      (c) dropped row-shift store    — 50m entry shifts but skips the M50_OBJ_ROW_SHIFT store; caught at 0x63B7.
 *      (d) wrong subtract constant    — 50m entry subtracts 0x3a instead of 0x3b; caught at 0x63B7.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-03fb.test.js
