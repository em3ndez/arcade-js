 * Equivalence test for composeScreenAndAdvanceSubstate (ROM 0x0A37) — in-game
 * sub-state 5: post a fixed four-message task batch, advance GAME_SUBSTATE (0x600A),
 * and stamp player 1's "1UP" marker (the sub_0a53 fall-through tail).
 *
 * loc_0a37 is a credited-game (GAME_STATE 3) sub-state handler — NOT reached in plain
 * attract (attract holds GAME_STATE 0) — and it WRITES memory (task ring, sub-state
 * byte, video RAM) via two decompiled callees. So it is gated by MEMORY-equivalence
 * against the frozen oracle (RAM − STACK_SCRATCH), with a FRESH clone per case, never
 * the full register file and never cycles:
 *
 *   1. REALISM (captured driven dispatch) — drive a coin+start into a credited game so
 *      the intro sequence reaches sub-state 5, hook 0x0A37, and clone the machine at
 *      the real dispatch. Run the ORACLE on one clone and the idiomatic routine on
 *      another and prove game-visible RAM (everything outside the dead STACK_SCRATCH)
 *      is byte-identical. The real dispatch has an empty ring (tail 0xEE, slots 0xFF),
 *      so it exercises the plain no-wrap post arm. The idiomatic routine models no
 *      stack, so it must also leave SP and pc unchanged from entry (the oracle's four
 *      `call`s + `ret` leave only push residue inside STACK_SCRATCH).
 *
 *   2. CRAFTED (ring states the run never reaches) — from the real entry, poke the ring
 *      IDENTICALLY on both sides into arms attract/one-shot never mint:
 *        - FULL: occupy the tail slot (bit 7 clear) so every post is dropped and the
 *          tail is left untouched — only the sub-state + marker change.
 *        - WRAP: set TASK_TAIL near the top (0xFC) so the 8-byte batch wraps 0xFF→0xC0
 *          mid-batch, pinning enqueueTask's wrap math across the whole batch.
 *      Each compared oracle vs idiomatic on RAM − STACK_SCRATCH.
 *
 *   3. TEETH — two deliberately-broken twins the diff MUST catch: (a) one that skips the
 *      GAME_SUBSTATE advance (a hung-intro bug), caught at 0x600A; (b) one that posts a
 *      wrong task byte, caught in the ring. A gate a real corruption slips through is
 *      worthless.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-0a37.test.js
