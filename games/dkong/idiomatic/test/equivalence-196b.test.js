 * Equivalence test for clearScreenAndSelectSubstate (ROM 0x196b) — arm 23 of the
 * in-game sub-state table (ROM 0x0702): wipe the whole display (call 0x0852), then
 * store GAME_SUBSTATE (0x600A) = (byte at 0x600E) + 0x12, a computed jump into a
 * later phase group.
 *
 * loc_196b WRITES memory (the clear footprint + a store to GAME_SUBSTATE) and READS
 * exactly ONE byte (0x600E). So it is validated by capture/clone/replay on a FRESH
 * clone per case — never reusing one machine, never the full register file, never
 * cycles. The compared contract is RAM minus STACK_SCRATCH + pc + SP; here pc/SP are
 * dropped (the idiomatic layer has no stack/PC bookkeeping) so the gate is RAM
 * (ex-stack). loc_196b touches no board io latch, so no io field is compared.
 *
 * 0x196b is UNREACHED in a plain attract run AND in a coin+start driven run (its
 * dispatch needs deep in-game progression to sub-state 23), so there is no real
 * dispatch to capture — exactly sub_0852's situation. It is gated by CRAFTED entries
 * built on a real in-game base (captured at ROM 0x0986, GAME_STATE==3). Because the
 * routine's behaviour is a total function of the single byte 0x600E, sweeping that
 * byte over ALL 256 values is EXHAUSTIVE over its input space:
 *
 *   1. CRAFTED (exhaustive over 0x600E) — for every value 0..255 of 0x600E, on a real
 *      in-game base with the clear footprint pre-painted to a sentinel (0xAA) on BOTH
 *      sides, run oracle vs candidate on two fresh clones and confirm identical RAM
 *      (ex-stack). Each arm also asserts the oracle's own outcome — GAME_SUBSTATE ==
 *      (v + 0x12) & 0xff — so no arm can pass vacuously; sampled arms assert the full
 *      clear (tilemap all 0x10, sprite buffer all 0x00) so the sentinel really was
 *      overwritten.
 *
 *   2. TEETH — three deliberately-broken twins MUST be caught: (a) a WRONG add offset
 *      (+0x11) — a RAM diff at GAME_SUBSTATE; (b) a SKIPPED clear — the sentinel
 *      survives inside the footprint (RAM diff there); (c) a ONE-CELL-SHORT tilemap
 *      fill — the sentinel survives at the last cell 0x77FF (RAM diff there), pinning
 *      the exact wipe extent.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-196b.test.js
