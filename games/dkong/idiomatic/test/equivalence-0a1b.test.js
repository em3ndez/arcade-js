/**
 * Equivalence test for loc_0a1b (ROM 0x0A1B) — the two-player board-setup step:
 * clear the palette bank, post two task-ring messages ([0x03,0x03] then [0x02,0x01]),
 * stamp player 2's "2UP" video marker, and advance GAME_SUBSTATE (0x600A) 4 -> 5.
 *
 * loc_0a1b WRITES memory (palette latches, task ring + tail, three video cells,
 * GAME_SUBSTATE) and calls two subroutines — not a pure leaf — so it is gated by
 * capture / clone / replay (docs/decompiler-pipeline), NOT the exhaustive-leaf pattern. A FRESH clone
 * is used per side because the routine mutates state.
 *
 * REACHABILITY. 1-player attract NEVER dispatches 0x0A1B: it is the TWO-PLAYER
 * alternation board-setup step (loc_0986 → sub_09fe → THIS → loc_0a37), and attract
 * is one-player, so loc_0986 takes its non-2P arm and the cascade never runs. Even a
 * driven 2-player *start* goes loc_0986 → sub_09d6 → loc_0a37 and skips this step —
 * 0x0A1B is the player-2-turn setup, which needs full alternation gameplay to reach
 * naturally. So every entry here is CRAFTED (docs/decompiler-pipeline "a real state with a surgical
 * nudge"): a REAL in-game 2-player machine (driven by a coin+START2 input tape) is
 * captured, and the task-ring state / palette bank / GAME_SUBSTATE / target video
 * cells are poked IDENTICALLY on both sides to exercise each arm.
 *
 *   1. EQUAL (crafted ring arms) — clean-write / occupied-slot DROP / wrap / second-
 *      slot-occupied, poked identically on both clones. For each, run the ORACLE on
 *      one clone and loc_0a1b on another and confirm they leave IDENTICAL RAM
 *      everywhere game-visible (diff confined to dead STACK_SCRATCH — the oracle
 *      models `call…/ret`, loc_0a1b uses the JS stack) AND the same palette bank.
 *
 *   2. EQUAL (non-vacuous) — pre-dirty the palette bank, GAME_SUBSTATE and the three
 *      P2 cells to garbage identically, then confirm loc_0a1b actively clears the
 *      palette to bank 0, sets GAME_SUBSTATE = 5, posts [0x03,0x03,0x02,0x01] into
 *      the ring, and stamps 0x02/0x25/0x20 — matching the oracle throughout — and
 *      leaves SP/pc unchanged (no stack modelling).
 *
 *   3. TEETH — two deliberately-broken twins MUST be caught: (a) one that drops the
 *      second task post (game-visible task-ring/tail diff), (b) one that leaves the
 *      high palette latch set (IO-state diff). A gate a real corruption slips through
 *      is worthless.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-0a1b.test.js
