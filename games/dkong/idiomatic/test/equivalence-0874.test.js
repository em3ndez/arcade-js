 * Equivalence test for clearPlayfieldAndSprites (ROM 0x0874) — the board/power-on
 * screen + sprite-buffer CLEAR (playfield fill + two side columns + sprite-buffer zero).
 *
 * sub_0874 WRITES memory (video RAM 0x7404.. playfield + 0x7522/0x7523 columns,
 * and work RAM 0x6900-0x6A7F) and reads NOTHING — every operand is an immediate, so
 * it is an input-free, straight-line constant memory transform. It is validated by
 * capture/clone/replay on a FRESH clone per case — never by reusing one machine,
 * never on the full register file, never on cycles. The contract compared is RAM
 * (minus STACK_SCRATCH); there are no live-out registers (see the routine header:
 * every one of the nine callers overwrites A/flags or does a flag-neutral load
 * before reading anything, so A/BC/DE/HL/F are dead ABI). SP and PC are likewise not
 * compared — the oracle's terminal `ret` pops the stack (SP += 2) and vectors PC;
 * the idiomatic layer drops that bookkeeping (the JS call stack replaces it).
 *
 *   1. REALISM — hook 0x0874 in a real attract run and clone the machine at each
 *      real dispatch (3 fire by frame 518: board/state setup). For each, run oracle
 *      vs clearPlayfieldAndSprites on two fresh clones and confirm identical RAM
 *      (ex-stack).
 *
 *   2. CRAFTED (footprint) — because the routine reads nothing, one start state with
 *      the three target regions pre-poked to a SENTINEL (0xEE, distinct from the fill
 *      bytes 0x10 / 0x00) — identically on both sides, plus guard bands around the
 *      sprite buffer — pins the EXACT write footprint against the oracle: any cell the
 *      candidate writes-but-oracle-doesn't (or misses) holds the sentinel on one side
 *      and a fill byte on the other, so the RAM gate bites. A handful of sentinel
 *      values are swept to be thorough.
 *
 *   3. TEETH — a deliberately-broken twin (a one-column-short playfield fill: 27
 *      columns per row, not 28) MUST be caught. On the sentinel entry the dropped
 *      column holds the sentinel vs the oracle's 0x10, so the RAM gate bites; it is
 *      also caught on the real captures (VRAM starts 0x00, so the dropped cells differ
 *      from the oracle's 0x10).
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-0874.test.js
