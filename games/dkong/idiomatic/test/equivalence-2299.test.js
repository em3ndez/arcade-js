/**
 * Equivalence test for loc_2299 (ROM 0x2299) — advance a board object to its next state
 * on a randomised pacing gate.
 *
 * loc_2299 is a LEAF and one of the four state-machine arms sub_2207 dispatches for a board
 * object. sub_2207's body picks the object's record base (0x6280 odd frames / 0x6288 even),
 * PUSHES it, and jumps into this arm; the arm's `pop hl` reads that record base back, so the
 * pointer arrives on the STACK, not in a register. The idiomatic routine models it honestly
 * as a PARAMETER — loc_2299(m, recordBase) — and returns plainly, dropping the oracle's
 * `pop hl` + `ret` bracket. The whole memory-observable behaviour is a function of just two
 * bytes: RANDOM (0x6018) decides the gate, and the record's state byte is what gets stepped.
 *
 * ABI: the oracle consumes exactly TWO stack slots on every path — the record base (`pop hl`)
 * and the caller return (`ret`). So runCandidate pops the record base off the crafted stack,
 * passes it as the honest argument, then does one m.ret() to line pc + SP up with the oracle.
 * The pushed slots live in STACK_SCRATCH and are excluded from the RAM diff (memory-equivalence
 * contract); they are identical on both sides anyway (the oracle only READS them).
 *
 *   1. EQUAL (exhaustive) — all 256 RANDOM values decide the gate completely; swept against
 *      both real record bases (0x6280 / 0x6288) and boundary state bytes (0x00, 0x02, 0xFF —
 *      including the 0xFF -> 0x00 wrap), on a real attract base. RAM − STACK_SCRATCH + pc + SP
 *      identical to the oracle across the whole product. A proof, not a sample.
 *
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted arms) — the two decisions made explicit with oracle-behaviour checks:
 *      gate OPEN (RANDOM & 0x3C == 0) steps the state byte to state+1 (non-vacuity: the byte
 *      really changed), gate CLOSED (RANDOM & 0x3C != 0) writes nothing outside the stack.
 *
 *   3. TEETH — three broken twins, each MUST be caught by the exhaustive sweep:
 *      (a) inverted gate — advances when it should linger and vice-versa.
 *      (b) dropped advance — never steps the state byte (caught AT the record base).
 *      (c) wrong mask (0x1C) — drops gate bit 5, so it advances on RANDOM values the oracle
 *          holds on (e.g. 0x20); justifies the exact 0x3C mask.
 *
 *   4. REACHABILITY — 0x2299 is NOT naturally dispatched in attract (sub_2207 runs every
 *      frame there but its object machine never reaches this arm), so there are no captured
 *      dispatches; the exhaustive gate sweep is the coverage. Any dispatch that DOES occur is
 *      verified against the oracle so the test stays correct if attract ever reaches it.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-2299.test.js
