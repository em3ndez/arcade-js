/**
 * Memory-equivalence test for initBoardState (ROM 0x0F56) — the per-board work-RAM
 * reset + bonus/timer setup + shared-sprite seed, which then tail-dispatches (via the
 * ROM 0x0FCD rst-0x28 table) to the board's own object setup (seed25m/50m/75m/100m).
 *
 * This is the cycle-free / memory-equivalence gate (docs/06), NOT the retired strict
 * whole-machine one. sub_0f56 WRITES a large span (0x6200–0x6226, 0x6280–0x6AFF, the
 * bonus bytes, and — via the dispatched board setup — the object/sprite records) and
 * reads only LEVEL (0x6229), BOARD (0x6227) and ROM. It has NO `ret`: it tail-jumps to
 * a board setup whose `ret` lands on a `call` (0x0D62) that reads no register it leaves,
 * so LIVE-OUT is memory-only. Every case therefore runs on a FRESH clone per side and
 * is compared on:
 *
 *     RAM (dumpState, minus STACK_SCRATCH) only.
 *
 * NOT COMPARED, deliberately (like the sibling equivalence-0fd7 gate): SP, PC, cycles,
 * and the full register file. The oracle threads PC through m.step and balances the Z80
 * stack across its rst-0x28 push/pop + m.call/ret; the idiomatic layer drops that model
 * (direct JS calls, no m.step), so PC differs and any transient stack write lands only in
 * STACK_SCRATCH, which the RAM diff skips.
 *
 *   1. REALISM — hook 0x0F56 in a real attract run and clone at each real dispatch.
 *      Attract plays 25m, so the board build dispatches this routine with BOARD == 1.
 *      Oracle vs initBoardState on two fresh clones leave identical RAM (ex-stack).
 *
 *   2. LEVEL SWEEP — the routine's only real computation is the bonus/period arithmetic,
 *      keyed off LEVEL (0x6229). Attract is level 1, so poke LEVEL = 0..255 identically
 *      both sides on a real BOARD == 1 capture and confirm RAM matches for every value —
 *      an exhaustive check of the *10-mod-256, the 0x50 clamp, and the period formula.
 *
 *   3. CRAFTED BOARD 2/3/4 — the other three dispatch arms attract never reaches. Take a
 *      real capture and poke BOARD (0x6227) = 2/3/4 identically both sides; the routine
 *      clears the object span itself, so the board setup reads a well-defined (zeroed)
 *      state on both sides. Board 4 also exercises the bit-2 skip of the 0x6A00 seed.
 *      Plus a full-footprint sentinel prefill (0x6200–0x6AFF, both sides) so any short,
 *      missing, or mis-placed write surfaces as a sentinel-vs-written mismatch.
 *
 *   4. TEETH — two deliberately-broken twins, each MUST be caught:
 *      (a) PERIOD-DOUBLE: drops the `add a,a`, computing 0xDC − bonus instead of
 *          0xDC − 2*bonus — caught at BONUS_PERIOD/BONUS_TICK on the real capture;
 *      (b) WRONG-GATE: gates the 0x6A00 seed on bit 1 instead of bit 2, so a crafted
 *          BOARD == 4 entry (which must SKIP the seed) is wrongly seeded — caught at 0x6A00.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-0f56.test.js
