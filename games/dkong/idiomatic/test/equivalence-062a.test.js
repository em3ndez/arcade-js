/**
 * Equivalence test for loc_062a (ROM 0x062A–0x0669) — task entry 10, one step of the on-screen
 * bonus readout.
 *
 * FOUR ARMS, AND ATTRACT REACHES TWO OF THEM. A 9000-frame attract run dispatches 0x062A 39
 * times: 35 on the tick arm (BONUS_DISPLAY non-zero) and 4 on the re-seed arm, always with
 * payload 1. It never reaches the payload-0 payout arm and never reaches the latch-set
 * do-nothing arm. So this gate is captures PLUS crafted entries, and each test says which it
 * is. A crafted entry is a real attract machine (boot + 600 frames, with the task dispatcher's
 * return address pushed) with the bytes that select the arm nudged — identically on both sides.
 *
 * EVERY ONE OF THOSE COUNTS IS ASSERTED, NOT JUST PRINTED, and that is deliberate: a capture
 * hook that silently stops catching dispatches (the classic form: a stub that does not survive
 * clone()) leaves an EMPTY corpus, and an empty corpus satisfies both a "the unreachable arms
 * stay unreached" check and a replay loop with nothing in it. This gate used to go fully green
 * in that state — it skipped its replay block and reported a pass. It now fails instead.
 *
 * THE CONTRACT IS RAM − STACK_SCRATCH plus the return value; pc and SP are NOT compared. The
 * oracle pushes IX once per column of the tile-block copy and its payout arm nests further
 * pushes and rets, all of which land in the dead STACK_SCRATCH region; the idiomatic rewrite
 * models no stack at all. Live-out is memory-only (see the routine's header), so the residual
 * registers and flags are dead and are not compared either — but the RETURN VALUE is, because
 * a RAM diff cannot see it.
 *
 *   1. REACHABILITY — report the natural dispatches and which arms they take, over 2500 and
 *      9000 frames; assert both runs caught something and that the 9000-frame run's per-arm
 *      tally is the 35 / 4 quoted above; and FAIL if attract ever starts reaching the two
 *      crafted arms (which would mean captures should replace the crafted entries).
 *   2. EQUAL (real captured dispatches) — replay EVERY real 0x062A entry the 2500-frame run
 *      produces, inline, all 15 of them: at this size sampling buys nothing, so there is no
 *      sampling policy to state and no sampled/total gap to reason about. The corpus is asserted
 *      non-empty and asserted to be exactly the 15 captures expected, so a hook that stops
 *      catching fails here rather than silently replaying nothing.
 *   3. EQUAL (exhaustive, re-seed arm) — sweep all 128 EVEN values of BONUS_START through the
 *      re-seed. THE ODD HALF IS EXCLUDED, and not because it passes: the ROM's divide loop
 *      steps by ten modulo 256 with no iteration guard, so an odd seed never reaches zero and
 *      BOTH sides spin forever. Sweeping it would hang the gate, not fail it. (No reachable
 *      input is odd — BONUS_START's only writer stores min((10*LEVEL + 40) mod 256, 80), which
 *      is even for every LEVEL. That is a code derivation, stated in the routine's header, not
 *      something this gate measures.)
 *   4. EQUAL (exhaustive, tick arm) — sweep all 255 non-zero BONUS_DISPLAY values.
 *   5. EQUAL (crafted, payout arm) — payload 0, swept over all 256 BONUS_DISPLAY values on a
 *      crafted base (ATTRACT cleared and a score set, so the add-to-score task's body really
 *      runs), with a non-vacuity check that the score moved.
 *   6. EQUAL (crafted, latch-set arm) — BONUS_DISPLAY 0 with the bottomed-out latch set: both
 *      sides must leave RAM exactly as they found it, and the same entry with the latch CLEAR
 *      must write, so the arm is not vacuously quiet.
 *   7. EQUAL (live-wire, whole attract) — 4000 frames of attract with the rewrite wired at
 *      0x062A, compared frame by frame against the all-oracle baseline over RAM −
 *      STACK_SCRATCH. THE ORACLE'S MEASURED CYCLE COST IS CHARGED BACK inside the override:
 *      the rewrite is cycle-free, and delete that one line and this test forks at 0x6019 (the
 *      cycle-derived spin counter) around frame 521 — a shifted vblank NMI, not a behaviour
 *      difference. Reproduce it that way rather than trusting the sentence.
 *   8. TEETH — three deliberately-broken twins of the real routine, each caught by the check
 *      named beside it:
 *        (a) dropped nibble swap (stores the raw quotient) — caught by the re-seed sweep; the
 *            twin's stored BONUS_DISPLAY byte is asserted to differ, because the first
 *            diverging byte in the dump is the render tail's music latch, which sits lower.
 *        (b) dropped latch guard (re-seeds even when the readout has bottomed out) — caught on
 *            the crafted latch-set entry.
 *        (c) tile block copied with the column stride lost — caught by the re-seed sweep, in
 *            video RAM.
 *
