 * Equivalence test for startBonusExpiredDelay (ROM 0x1A15) — the INIT step (idx1) of the
 * bonus-expired death sequence: clear BONUS_EXPIRED_DELAY (0x6387) to 0, advance
 * BONUS_EXPIRED_STEP (0x6386) from 1 to 2.
 *
 * loc_1a15 READS no memory and no register — it writes two constants (0x6387 ← 0,
 * 0x6386 ← 2) and calls nothing. Its behaviour is therefore INPUT-INDEPENDENT: a single
 * entry exercises the whole routine, and its correctness on any state is its correctness
 * on every state. So it is validated by running it directly on many real full-RAM
 * backgrounds and against the oracle, with the two output bytes seeded to SENTINELS so
 * each write is observable:
 *
 *   1. EQUAL (fresh sentinel entry) — startBonusExpiredDelay == oracle on RAM −
 *      STACK_SCRATCH, and the oracle's own result IS the documented effect (0x6386 → 2,
 *      0x6387 → 0) — proving the writes are real, not a vacuous no-op match.
 *
 *   2. EQUAL (real captured backgrounds) — 0x1A15 is NEVER dispatched in attract (BONUS
 *      never reaches 0), but its dispatcher entry_1a07 (0x1A07) fires every gameplay frame.
 *      Hook 0x1A07, clone REAL fully-populated 25m states, seed the two output bytes to
 *      sentinels + a safe SP onto each (keeping the rest of the real RAM background), and
 *      confirm the candidate reproduces the oracle's RAM − STACK_SCRATCH. Because the
 *      routine reads nothing, any real background is a valid bed; this also proves it
 *      touches ONLY 0x6386/0x6387 and nothing else in a live memory image.
 *
 *   3. TEETH — two deliberately-broken twins, one per write, each of which the compare
 *      MUST catch:
 *        (a) broken-step  — writes 3 to BONUS_EXPIRED_STEP instead of 2; caught at 0x6386.
 *        (b) broken-delay — drops the BONUS_EXPIRED_DELAY clear; the 0x6387 sentinel
 *            survives and the diff catches it.
 *
 * Contract: RAM − STACK_SCRATCH (the memory-equivalence contract). LIVE-OUT is memory
 * only; the oracle's terminal `ret` pops the stack inside STACK_SCRATCH (SP seeded there)
 * and is excluded, and the dispatcher ignores the handler's residual registers/flags — so
 * neither SP/pc nor the register file is compared (never the full register file, never
 * cycles).
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-1a15.test.js
