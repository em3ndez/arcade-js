/**
 * Equivalence test for loc_3e99 (ROM 0x3E99) — the board-1 arm of the overlap-search dispatch:
 * clear OVERLAP_COUNT, count overlaps across OBJ_ARRAY_67 (10 records) then OBJ_ARRAY_64 (5),
 * and grade the shared total into the unary code 0 / 1 / 3 / 7 — zero, one, two or three low bits
 * set, which is the form the consumer walks a bit at a time.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE ACTUALLY EXERCISES (no coverage claimed that is not produced by a line here):
 *
 *   0. REACHABILITY — hooks 0x3E99 in a real 6000-frame attract run and reports the count. It
 *      is NOT vacuous: the arm really is dispatched (8 times, first at frame 605). But it is
 *      also NARROW, and the test asserts that narrowness rather than glossing it: every natural
 *      dispatch arrives with the SAME bounds word (0x1308) and the same probe record (Mario's),
 *      and the totals attract produces are only 0 and 1 — so the natural traffic reaches the
 *      code-0 and code-1 arms ONLY. Codes 3 and 7, the caller's other bounds word (0x0508, the one
 *      it picks when P1_INPUT holds no horizontal direction), and any overlap found in the SECOND
 *      array are unreachable from attract and are covered by crafted entries.
 *
 *   1. EQUAL (captured) — every real dispatch replayed oracle-vs-candidate.
 *
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted) — real attract RAM with a surgical nudge, identical on both sides: all
 *      four code arms including the exactly-2 and exactly-3 boundaries, an overlap found only
 *      in the second array, a first-array hit at the LAST scanned index (pins the 10-record count
 *      and the 32-byte stride), a second-array hit at its last index (pins the 5-record count), a
 *      non-zero starting counter (pins the clear), and both bounds words over one geometry that
 *      only the wider window admits (pins the stack-passed word AND its byte order).
 *
 *   REPEATED-CALLEE COVERAGE, stated because the brief expected recursion here: 0x3E99 is NOT
 *   self-recursive — see the note below — but it does call ONE shared callee TWICE with different
 *   arguments, accumulating into a single counter. That is the structural risk this file targets:
 *   the crafted set includes overlaps in the first array only, the second array only, and one in
 *   EACH (the code-3 case), so no test passes unless both invocations run, in order, into the
 *   same counter.
 *
 * NOT SELF-RECURSIVE, verified from the ROM rather than assumed: across the whole 16KB main ROM
 * the address 0x3E99 appears exactly once, as the board-1 word of the jump table at 0x3E8D — no
 * `call`/`jp` anywhere targets it. Its only callee, 0x3EC3, is a flat counted loop containing no
 * call at all. The 0x3E99 → 0x3EC3 subtree is depth 1 and acyclic.
 *
 * CONTRACT. The oracle models the Z80 stack: it pops the dispatcher's bounds word, brackets each
 * scan with a call/return, and finishes with an ordinary `ret`. The candidate pops the same word
 * (a genuine data hand-off) but direct-calls its callee and returns in JS, so the harness performs
 * the ONE terminal return the ROM nets, lining pc + SP up. The bytes the oracle's dissolved
 * brackets leave behind land in the dead STACK_SCRATCH region, which the memory compare excludes.
 * Compared: RAM − STACK_SCRATCH, pc, SP, and the overlap code (the oracle leaves it in A; the
 * candidate must leave the same value in A *and* return it).
 *
 * The oracle's residual B / DE / IX / HL are NOT compared, and that is a claim about the ROM, not
 * a convenience: this routine's `ret` lands at 0x286E, whose `ret` lands at 0x1C23, and 0x1C23's
 * first instruction re-tests A — so the flags are dead too, and nothing reads the loop residue.
 *
 * TEETH — five broken twins, each MUST be caught:
 *   (a) skips the counter clear            -> caught in RAM at OVERLAP_COUNT
 *   (b) drops the second array's scan       -> caught in RAM at OVERLAP_COUNT
 *   (c) swaps the two bounds bytes          -> caught in RAM at OVERLAP_COUNT
 *   (d) scans 9 first-array records, not 10 -> caught in RAM at OVERLAP_COUNT
 *   (e) grades a total of 2 as 7, not 3     -> RAM is IDENTICAL; caught ONLY in the code live-out,
 *                                              which is what proves that assertion earns its place
