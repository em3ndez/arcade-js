/**
 * Equivalence test for loc_333d (ROM 0x333D) — the switch between a 0x6400-array object's two
 * travel states and its on-foot state.
 *
 * WHAT IS COMPARED. RAM − STACK_SCRATCH, plus the return value. The routine has ONE exit as far
 * as its caller is concerned: its own return and the two unwinds its callees perform (loc_33a1's
 * height skip, loc_236e's table miss) all land at the same continuation, ROM 0x3233, so the
 * idiomatic twin returns `undefined` on every path and the gate asserts that on both sides —
 * a stray `false` would make the seam eat a second stack word. pc/SP are NOT compared: they are
 * the Z80 stack idiom the plain JS return replaces.
 *
 * THE EXCLUSION IS PROVED, NOT ASSUMED. Every case checks the ORACLE's own write footprint and
 * requires each address to be either one of the three record bytes (+0x0d, +0x1d, +0x1f) or
 * inside STACK_SCRATCH — so the excluded window cannot be hiding a real difference.
 *
 *   0. REACHABILITY — 0x333D is dispatched naturally during attract. The test measures the count
 *      and classifies every capture by the arm the ORACLE takes, then asserts WHICH arms attract
 *      reaches and, just as importantly, which it does NOT. Attract enters only with the state
 *      byte 1 or 8, so it reaches four arms (ARMS_ATTRACT_REACHES) and misses seven
 *      (ARMS_ATTRACT_MISSES) — including everything on the descent side and the guard's skip.
 *      Both lists are asserted, so neither can quietly change without this test failing.
 *   1. EQUAL (captured) — EVERY captured dispatch replayed oracle-vs-candidate on fresh clones.
 *      No sampling: the natural dispatch count is small enough to replay in full, and test 0
 *      asserts the capture is complete, so entry-shape coverage of the run is total by
 *      construction rather than by a separate check. The distinct shapes seen are reported.
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted) — the arms attract never reaches, planted on a real machine state: both
 *      arrivals, the +0x19 == 2 mark and its absence, the descent arm that must NOT mark, the
 *      8-bit wrap of the biased Y base, the guard's two outcomes, the table miss, both lookup
 *      tags, a rescan past a non-matching entry, and the Mario comparison at its exact boundary.
 *   3. LIVE (whole attract) — the live-out measurement. The candidate is wired at 0x333D for a
 *      real 4000-frame attract run and the frame trace is diffed against the all-oracle baseline
 *      on every live cell outside STACK_SCRATCH. A second run repeats it with every register
 *      except the record pointer deliberately clobbered on the way out, which is what makes
 *      "no register live-out" a measurement rather than a reading of the caller.
 *      ★ The oracle's measured cycle cost is restored inside the override. Without that the run
 *      diverges at frame 1080 (at 0x6019) purely because cycle-free code shifts the NMI — a
 *      timing artifact, not a difference in this routine. Test 3 carries that as a teeth case so
 *      the restoration cannot be dropped silently.
 *      COVERAGE: attract only. Gameplay, the other three boards, and every arm listed in test 2
 *      are NOT exercised live — test 2 is what covers those, and it covers them statically.
 *   4. TEETH — eight broken twins, each of which this contract MUST catch.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-333d.test.js
