 * Equivalence test for stageAward300Popup (ROM 0x1E00) — load this effect-sprite arm's constant
 * (B=0x7D code, DE=0x0003 task message) and delegate to the shared stageAwardPopupAtHitObject tail.
 *
 * stageAward300Popup's own body is a straight-line "set two constants, delegate" — no branches of
 * its own. But it WRITES memory (through stageAwardPopupAtHitObject → enqueueTask + stampScorePopupSprite: the task ring,
 * the block[0] clear at *(0x6343), the sprite record 0x6A30..0x6A33, and the gated sound
 * 0x6085), so it is gated by capture / clone / replay (docs/decompiler-pipeline) with a FRESH clone per
 * case — never a reused clone. The two things this setter alone can get wrong are the two
 * CONSTANTS it loads; the composition arms below inherit the stageAwardPopupAtHitObject /
 * stampScorePopupSprite / enqueueTask branches. Attract dispatches this arm only on 25m (BOARD 1) with a free ring slot, so
 * the closed arms are reached with crafted entries:
 *
 *   1. REALISM (real captured dispatch) — pickRandomAwardTier lands on stageAward300Popup (RANDOM bits 0/1
 *      clear) while the 25m demo plays. Run the ORACLE on one clone and idiomatic stageAward300Popup
 *      on another and confirm every game-visible byte matches; the residual is confined to
 *      STACK_SCRATCH (the oracle models `jp 0x1e15 … call 0x309f`, pushing to SP-4; stageAward300Popup
 *      uses the JS call stack and models neither SP nor pc). Also asserts the two constants
 *      actually landed: record[1] (0x6A31) == 0x7D and the posted task argument == 0x03.
 *
 *   2. BOARD (exhaustive crafted) — stampScorePopupSprite's sound gate is the chain's only
 *      board-dependent logic and attract exercises only BOARD 1, so on a real entry poke
 *      BOARD to EVERY byte 0..255 identically on both sides and compare game-visible RAM.
 *      Pins the 50m/100m CLOSED arms (no 0x6085 write) attract never reaches.
 *
 *   3. DROP arm (crafted) — occupy the ring slot at the tail so enqueueTask silently drops
 *      (bit7 clear), exercising the composition on the full-ring path attract's free-slot
 *      writes never reach; the tail must stay put on both sides.
 *
 *   4. TEETH — two twins the REALISM replay MUST catch, each a wrong constant that only
 *      this setter can introduce: (a) loads B=0x7E not 0x7D — caught at record[1] 0x6A31;
 *      (b) loads DE=0x0005 not 0x0003 — caught at the posted task argument in the ring.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-1e00.test.js
