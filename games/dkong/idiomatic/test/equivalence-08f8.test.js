/**
 * Equivalence test for commitGameStart (ROM 0x08F8) — commit a credited game start.
 *
 * commitGameStart WRITES a lot of memory (CREDITS via spendCredit, the task ring via
 * enqueueTask, both player context records, the tilemap + sprite buffer via
 * clearPlayfieldAndSprites, TWO_PLAYER_GAME, GAME_SUBSTATE, GAME_STATE) and is deep in
 * a call cascade, so it is gated by capture / clone / replay (docs/decompiler-pipeline) with a FRESH
 * clone per case. Because it under-charges cycles (no m.step), the strict whole-machine
 * byte-exact gate does not apply; the contract is RAM (minus STACK_SCRATCH) + candidate
 * SP/pc unchanged, exactly the memory-equivalence contract.
 *
 *   1. REALISM (real captured dispatches) — a coin+start1 tape drives the credited state.
 *      commitGameStart is dispatched every credited frame: ~33 times on the NEITHER arm
 *      (no start pressed -> do nothing) and once on the real 1-PLAYER start (CREDITS==1
 *      -> A=0x04). Replay the ORACLE on one clone and commitGameStart on another and
 *      confirm every game-visible byte matches; the only tolerated residue is
 *      STACK_SCRATCH (the oracle models push/call/ret, commitGameStart uses the JS call
 *      stack). commitGameStart must leave SP and pc at their entry values.
 *
 *   2. CRAFTED (2-PLAYER arm) — attract/one-coin never presses START2 with >1 credit, so
 *      the 2-player arm is forced from a real credited entry: poke CREDITS=2 (so the
 *      selector allows START2), FRAME to a non-draw frame, and assert IN2's START2 bit,
 *      identically on both sides. Confirms the two-credit spend, the P2 context seed, the
 *      player-2 task, and TWO_PLAYER_GAME=1.
 *
 *   3. CRAFTED (both-buttons NEITHER arm) — A==0x0C (START1|START2 both held) must do
 *      NOTHING. Forced the same way with both start bits asserted; RAM stays identical to
 *      the oracle and unchanged from entry.
 *
 *   4. TEETH — two broken twins the gates MUST catch:
 *        A. drops the 1P/2P distinction (TWO_PLAYER_GAME always 0) — invisible on the 1P
 *           and NEITHER arms, caught ONLY by the crafted 2-PLAYER arm (proves that
 *           coverage is load-bearing).
 *        B. fails to advance the game (GAME_STATE := 2 instead of 3) — the routine's whole
 *           point; caught by the real 1-PLAYER dispatch (proves the realism gate has teeth).
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-08f8.test.js
