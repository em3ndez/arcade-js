/**
 * Memory-equivalence test for buildBoardWhenTimerExpires (ROM 0x0C91) — the countdown-gated board (re)build:
 * tick SUBSTATE_TIMER (0x6009) down by one and, ONLY on the frame it reaches zero, run the
 * board builder (buildBoard / ROM 0x0C92). While the timer is still above zero the routine
 * does nothing this frame.
 *
 * This is the CYCLE-FREE / memory-equivalence gate (docs/decompiler-pipeline), not the
 * retired strict whole-machine one. The two sides are compared on the go-forward contract:
 *
 *     RAM (dumpState, minus STACK_SCRATCH), PLUS the palette-bank output latch.
 *
 * pc and SP are deliberately NOT compared: the oracle models the rst-0x18 skip idiom with
 * push16/step/ret (it pushes the fall-through address 0x0C92, then either returns to it —
 * build — or discards it and returns two levels up — skip). All that traffic lands in the
 * dead STACK_SCRATCH region, which the direct-call idiomatic side replaces with a plain JS
 * `if (!tickSubstateTimer(m)) return; buildBoard(m);`. The caller consumes no return value.
 * The palette-bank latch is I/O device state (io.paletteBank), NOT part of dumpState — the
 * display reads it to pick its colour set — so it is checked directly alongside the RAM diff.
 *
 * REACHABILITY. buildBoardWhenTimerExpires is the 0x0702 sub-state table's index-10 arm (game state 3, sub-
 * state 0x0A), the in-PLAY entry into the builder; a plain attract run never reaches it
 * (attract's 25m build comes in through handler_0763's ungated tail jump instead). So each
 * board's real entry is FORCED with an identical-both-sides board poke at frame 100
 * (GAME_STATE=3, GAME_SUBSTATE=0x0A, SUBSTATE_TIMER=1, BOARD=1..4); buildBoardWhenTimerExpires then dispatches
 * once under the vblank service with the real board, giving a REAL captured entry (real
 * register file, real stack, entry SP in STACK_SCRATCH). timer==1 at entry makes those the
 * EXPIRY / build path; the SKIP path is crafted by poking a larger timer (and the timer==0
 * wrap-past-zero) identically on both sides of a captured entry.
 *
 * Jobs:
 *   1. EQUAL (build / expiry) — for every board 1..4, oracle vs buildBoardWhenTimerExpires on fresh clones of
 *      the real entry leave identical RAM (−STACK_SCRATCH) and identical palette bank. Both
 *      clones are pre-seeded with a sentinel palette bank + a sentinel board scratch so a
 *      match proves the writes actually happened. Non-vacuous: the timer decremented into
 *      the builder, the board scratch was reset to 0, SND_BGM + palette bank hold the board's
 *      values, and SUBSTATE_TIMER was reloaded by the setup arm (to 64). The dead stack
 *      traffic is proven load-bearing to the mask (stackDiffCount > 0).
 *   2. EQUAL (skip / still counting) — poke SUBSTATE_TIMER to 5, 2 (the just-above-expiry
 *      boundary), and 0 (wrap-past-zero: expiry is only the 1->0 tick, never 0->255)
 *      identically on both sides. oracle vs buildBoardWhenTimerExpires leave identical RAM (−STACK_SCRATCH):
 *      the timer counts down one and NOTHING else changes (the builder did not run — the
 *      sentinel board scratch survives).
 *   3. TEETH — two broken twins, each MUST be caught on a skip-path entry:
 *      (a) inverted gate — builds the board while the timer is still counting; the builder's
 *          writes (board scratch reset, palette bank, tune) show up where the correct routine
 *          leaves them untouched.
 *      (b) dropped countdown tick — never decrements SUBSTATE_TIMER; caught at SUBSTATE_TIMER
 *          on the skip path (correct 4 vs twin 5), where the builder does not overwrite it.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-0c91.test.js
