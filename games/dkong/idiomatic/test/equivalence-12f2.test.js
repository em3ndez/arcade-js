/**
 * Equivalence test for losePlayer1Life (ROM 0x12f2) — the P1 life-loss sub-state handler.
 *
 * 0x12f2 is a game-state-3 sub-state handler (dispatch index 0x0E), reached only in a
 * credited game the instant player 1 loses a life. Plain attract is game-state 1, so the
 * routine is NEVER dispatched there and cannot be captured live. It is therefore gated
 * with CRAFTED ENTRIES per doc-06: a real mid-attract machine (a valid, in-distribution
 * work-RAM image) is the base, and the death-handler's few input bytes are poked
 * IDENTICALLY on both sides to force each arm. Every case runs the frozen oracle on one
 * fresh clone and losePlayer1Life on another, then diffs RAM outside the dead stack —
 * a memory-writing routine demands a fresh clone per side.
 *
 *   1. CRAFTED — every arm, poked identically on both sides:
 *      (a) lives remain, 1-player  (LIVES>1, TWO_PLAYER_GAME=0) -> GAME_SUBSTATE 0x08.
 *      (b) lives remain, 2-player  (LIVES>1, TWO_PLAYER_GAME=1) -> GAME_SUBSTATE 0x17.
 *      (c) game over,    1-player  (LIVES=1, TWO_PLAYER_GAME=0, ATTRACT=0) -> loc_13ca
 *          full body, sub_1826 banner @0x76D4, one queued task, SUBSTATE_TIMER=0xC0,
 *          GAME_SUBSTATE=0x10.
 *      (d) game over,    2-player  (LIVES=1, TWO_PLAYER_GAME=1, ATTRACT=0) -> extra
 *          task queued first, banner @0x76D3.
 *      (e) game over, ATTRACT=1 — loc_13ca hits its rst-0x08 early abort, the rest of
 *          0x12f2 still runs (the abort returns into 0x12f2 either way).
 *      Each with a couple of score seedings so loc_13ca's format/rank runs on real data.
 *
 *   2. SANITY — asserts the oracle really took the arm each crafted case targets
 *      (LIVES decremented, the expected GAME_SUBSTATE, the P1_CONTEXT snapshot), so a
 *      green diff is against a MEANINGFUL oracle result, not two identical no-ops.
 *
 *   3. TEETH — three deliberately-broken twins the diff MUST catch:
 *      (a) wrong resume routing (ignores TWO_PLAYER_GAME) — caught on the 2P-resume arm.
 *      (b) skipped life decrement — caught at LIVES (and the saved context / branch).
 *      (c) wrong game-over sub-state (0x11) — caught at GAME_SUBSTATE on a game-over arm.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-12f2.test.js
