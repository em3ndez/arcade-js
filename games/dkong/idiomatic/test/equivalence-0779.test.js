/**
 * Equivalence test for composeAttractTitleScreen (ROM 0x0779) — the attract
 * title/score-screen composer (GAME_STATE 1, sub-state 0).
 *
 * The routine WRITES a lot of memory (task ring, sub-state timer/index, playfield +
 * sprite buffer, score labels, coinage digits) and calls six sub-routines, so it is NOT
 * a pure leaf. It is gated by capture / clone / replay (docs/decompiler-pipeline) with a FRESH clone per
 * case (it mutates RAM), never the exhaustive-leaf pattern. The diff is whole-RAM minus
 * STACK_SCRATCH: the oracle models each call's push/ret stack traffic (its SP/pc move)
 * while the idiomatic routine uses the JS call stack and models neither, so the only
 * tolerated residue is the pushed bytes in the dead stack scratch.
 *
 *   1. EQUAL (real captured dispatches) — hook 0x0779 in a real attract run and clone
 *      the machine at each true dispatch (~4 per long run, as the title screen is
 *      composed). For each: run the ORACLE on one clone and composeAttractTitleScreen on
 *      another; game-visible RAM must be identical (diff confined to STACK_SCRATCH). Also
 *      assert the idiomatic routine leaves SP and pc UNCHANGED (no stack/ret modelling).
 *      Attract is always 1-player with 2P-coins == 2, so this covers the 1P path only.
 *
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted arms) — the arms attract never reaches, forced by poking ONE byte
 *      IDENTICALLY on both sides of a real entry (docs/decompiler-pipeline crafted entry):
 *        - TWO_PLAYER (0x600F = 1): the `cp 1 / call z` arm fires draw2UpLabel (the 2UP
 *          label at 0x74A0/0x74C0/0x74E0).
 *        - TENS_CARRY (0x6023 = 10): the first digit-writer pass hits the D==10 split,
 *          stamping a ones 0 at 0x756E and a tens 1 in the carry cell 0x758E.
 *        - FULL_RING (ring all occupied): every one of the nine task posts is dropped and
 *          TASK_TAIL is left untouched.
 *      Plus a positive CLEAN-ring content check that pins the exact task payload this
 *      handler lays down and the 0xC0 -> 0xD2 tail advance (9 messages x 2 bytes).
 *
 *   3. TEETH — a twin that DROPS the second title-string post (arg 0x1C) — a plausible
 *      off-by-one in the direct posts. It writes one fewer ring slot and advances the
 *      tail two short, so it MUST be caught both on captured dispatches and on a
 *      deterministic clean-ring entry. A gate a real corruption slips through is worthless.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-0779.test.js
