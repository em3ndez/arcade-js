 * Equivalence test for reverseStepDirection (ROM 0x26de) — the direction-step sign
 * flip. sub_26de reads the byte at (HL) and rewrites it to +2 (0x02) when bit 7 is
 * set or -2 (0xFE) when it is clear; it is a LEAF that touches exactly one byte (a
 * read + a write, both at (HL)) and calls nothing. Its behaviour is a TOTAL function
 * of the one input byte — only bit 7 of (HL) is read — so it is gated the strongest
 * way a memory-writing leaf can be: EXHAUSTIVELY over all 256 possible (HL) values,
 * on a real captured attract machine, compared on RAM (minus STACK_SCRATCH) + pc + SP.
 * Every case runs on a FRESH clone (the routine WRITES memory, so no clone is reused).
 *
 * Live-out is memory-only (the byte at (HL)): the three callers read no register/flag
 * on return, and the downstream consumer sub_2523 reads the MEMORY byte, not any
 * register the oracle leaves — so the register file is deliberately NOT compared.
 *
 *   0. REACHABILITY — attract never dispatches 0x26de (sub_25f2's countdown family
 *      runs only in real gameplay). Asserted at 0, which is exactly why the gate is
 *      crafted-entry + exhaustive rather than real-dispatch. The SAME host run
 *      captures a real mid-attract machine (via 0x2333, reached on 25m) to use as the
 *      realistic base for the crafted entries.
 *
 *   1. EQUAL (exhaustive) — for each real target address (0x62A1/0x62A3/0x62A6, the
 *      addresses the real callers point HL at) sweep ALL 256 (HL) values, staged like
 *      a real call (return 0x264C on the stack), and confirm reverseStepDirection ==
 *      oracle on RAM-STACK_SCRATCH + pc + SP. 768 cases cover the whole input domain.
 *
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted arms) — the two explicit arms (bit 7 set -> +2, bit 7 clear ->
 *      -2), each confirmed identical to the oracle and cross-checked against the exact
 *      expected output byte + a sanity check on the oracle's ret (pc/SP).
 *
 *   3. FOOTPRINT — the oracle writes exactly ONE non-stack byte, (HL); nothing else.
 *      This licenses the "touches only (HL)" claim in the routine header.
 *
 *   4. TEETH — two deliberately-broken twins, each MUST be caught:
 *      (a) a wrong-bit twin (reads bit 6 instead of bit 7 for the sign) — a plausible
 *          off-by-one-bit bug, caught by the RAM diff wherever bit 6 != bit 7;
 *      (b) an extra-stack-pop twin (a leaked pop the direct-call routine must NOT do)
 *          — caught by the SP diff on every case.
 *
 * The idiomatic routine models the Z80 `ret` as a JS return (no stack modelling), so
 * the harness performs one m.ret() on the candidate clone AFTER the call to line pc +
 * SP up with the oracle (which rets internally). The oracle only READS the stack (the
 * ret pop), never writes it, so RAM is byte-equal on both sides regardless.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-26de.test.js
