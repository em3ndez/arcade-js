/**
 * Memory-equivalence gate for loc_1fac (ROM 0x1FAC).
 *
 * REACHABILITY WAS MEASURED FIRST, and it is what this file is shaped around: a capturing
 * override at 0x1FAC over 3000 attract frames sees 446 real dispatches, the first at frame ~728,
 * spread over six OBJ_ARRAY_67 record bases. So the captured half is not vacuous — but attract
 * exercises only part of the routine, and the header says which part.
 *
 * COVERAGE — ATTRACT ONLY, PLUS ONE CRAFTED SWEEP. Nothing here enters credited gameplay, board
 * 2-4 or two-player. Two things attract cannot produce are covered by crafted entries built on a
 * REAL capture: the record byte +0x15 is 0 on every one of the 446 dispatches (so the rotate that
 * builds the arrival sprite code is never exercised naturally — only the constant is), and the
 * travel field never wraps past its top value.
 *
 * WHY REHOST AND NOT clone(). 0x1FAC's tail chain RE-ENTERS 0x1FAC: the shared sprite tail at ROM
 * 0x21BA jumps back into the per-slot walk, which dispatches the remaining slots. `Machine.clone()`
 * rebuilds its registry from `assets`, so a clone would carry this file's capturing override and
 * recurse. Every replay here is therefore rehosted into a FRESH, override-free `Machine`, where
 * nested dispatches run the pure oracle on both sides.
 *
 * EVERY DISPATCH IS REPLAYED, INLINE, TWICE OVER — no sampling. At each dispatch the harness
 * rehosts twice, runs the oracle on one and the candidate on the other, compares, and discards, so
 * the cost is O(1) in memory. The two replay modes are:
 *
 *   CHAIN   — the frozen tails at ROM 0x1FCE and 0x21BA run for real, so the whole rest of the
 *             10-slot walk executes on both sides. Because this rewrite performs every one of the
 *             oracle's stack operations (the entire tail chain is still the oracle, and the head
 *             touches the stack on neither arm), the stack region legitimately matches, so the
 *             comparison is the FULL state dump INCLUDING STACK_SCRATCH, plus pc, SP, the whole
 *             register file, and the return value.
 *   STUBBED — both tails are replaced, on each fresh machine, by a marker stub that records where
 *             control was handed over and in what register state, and returns. This is the
 *             manufactured observable for a routine whose return value is always `undefined`: it
 *             isolates the head, pins WHICH tail the branch chose, and is the only thing that
 *             makes the shadow-bank swap visible (the real 0x21BA swaps back, hiding it). The stub
 *             is installed on each fresh machine — a stub does not survive a rehost any more than
 *             a clone — and every replay asserts the marker actually fired.
 *
 * Checks: EQUAL over all 446 captured dispatches in both modes; EQUAL over the crafted sweep; four
 * broken twins, each observed catching its own defect, with the shift-for-rotate twin asserted to
 * be INVISIBLE to every natural dispatch and caught by the crafted sweep alone; and a live-wire run
 * of the whole attract sequence with the rewrite dispatched at 0x1FAC, against a baseline that is
 * the same machine with an oracle-delegating override at the same address, so the ONLY difference
 * between the two runs is this routine. That run asserts a non-zero dispatch count on both sides.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-1fac.test.js
