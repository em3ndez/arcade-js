/**
 * Equivalence test for advanceSubstateWhenGrounded (ROM 0x1a2a) — the idx3 WAIT+EXIT
 * step of the bonus-expired sub-state machine.
 *
 * loc_1a2a's entire memory+control behaviour is a total function of TWO bytes:
 *   - MARIO_AIRBORNE (0x6216) selects the branch: != 0 -> hold (return true, no RAM
 *     write); == 0 -> run the shared tail (0x19d2) and caller-skip (return false).
 *   - GAME_SUBSTATE (0x600A) is the byte that grounded tail increments (mod 256).
 * SUBSTATE_TIMER (0x6009) is written to 0x40 unconditionally on the grounded arm.
 * Everything else the oracle touches is the Z80 return mechanism (SP/PC + a pushed
 * return address) the direct-call model drops — it lands only in STACK_SCRATCH, which
 * is excluded from the contract. So the contract is: RAM (minus STACK_SCRATCH) + the
 * boolean caller-skip return. That makes the strongest gate available:
 *
 *   1. EQUAL (exhaustive) — advanceSubstateWhenGrounded == oracle over all 65,536
 *      (airborne x substate) combos, compared on RAM (minus STACK_SCRATCH) AND the
 *      boolean return. 65,536 is the complete input space — a proof, not a sample.
 *      Each entry seeds SUBSTATE_TIMER with a 0x99 sentinel so a dropped re-arm would
 *      show in the RAM diff.
 *
 *   2. TEETH (two twins, complementary — one per half of the contract):
 *        (a) always-advance — drops the airborne gate (advances + returns false even
 *            when airborne). Caught by the RAM diff (advances GAME_SUBSTATE when the
 *            oracle wrote nothing). Proves the airborne gate is checked.
 *        (b) inverted-return — does the correct RAM work but returns the wrong
 *            boolean. RAM is identical, so it is caught ONLY by the return check —
 *            proving the caller-skip signal (a live-out RAM alone does not cover) has
 *            teeth.
 *
 *   3. REALISM (crafted entries) — 0x1a2a is unreachable in attract (BONUS_EXPIRED_STEP
 *      never reaches idx3), so real states are captured at its PARENT router 0x1a07
 *      (which fires every cascade frame), then poked to force each branch identically
 *      on both sides. Confirms the rewrite matches the oracle on states the game really
 *      produces.
 *
 * A FRESH clone per side everywhere: the routine WRITES memory on the grounded arm, so
 * a reused machine would carry the previous advance forward (docs/decompiler-pipeline: only a pure
 * read-only leaf may reuse one).
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-1a2a.test.js
