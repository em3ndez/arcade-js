/**
 * Equivalence test for loc_2079 (ROM 0x2079) — retire the object record the movement branch was
 * stepping (clear OBJ_ACTIVE and OBJ_X), then jump into the shared object-sprite tail at 0x21BA.
 *
 * The idiomatic routine writes two record bytes and hands the frame on with m.call(0x21BA), still
 * the frozen oracle. The ENTIRE tail chain runs on both sides — 0x21BA, the walk's loop advance at
 * 0x1F8D, every remaining slot, and the return to ROM 0x1986 — so the compared contract can
 * include pc, SP and the propagated return value alongside RAM − STACK_SCRATCH. That makes this
 * gate stronger than a leaf gate: a register or flag the chain really consumed would surface here
 * as a difference rather than having to be argued about.
 *
 *   0. REACHABILITY — 0x2079 IS reached naturally, but rarely. Exactly 2 dispatches in a
 *      6000-frame attract run and exactly 2 in a 6000-frame credited 1-player game (coin + start
 *      through the ROM's own credit logic, no pokes). ALL FOUR are replayed — no sampling. They
 *      cover both edges of the caller's admitting window (OBJ_X 248 and OBJ_X 7) and two
 *      different OBJ_ARRAY_67 record bases.
 *   1. EQUAL (real dispatches) — each captured entry replayed oracle-vs-candidate on fresh
 *      clones, plus a non-vacuity check that the oracle really did clear both record bytes.
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted sweep) — 1024 entries built on a real capture: all 256 OBJ_X values crossed
 *      with four OBJ_ACTIVE values. This is the coverage the two natural X values cannot give,
 *      and it pins that the routine does NOT re-test the caller's window.
 *   3. EQUAL (crafted record bases) — the record pointer moved to each of the ten OBJ_ARRAY_67
 *      bases, so the two writes are pinned as record-relative rather than absolute.
 *   4. WRITE-SET — inside the record, the oracle changes exactly OBJ_ACTIVE and OBJ_X. This is the
 *      falsifiable form of the header's role line: a third byte, or a different pair, fails it.
 *   5. LIVE-OUT PROBE — the header claims no register and no flag survives. Measured: the real
 *      routine, with the accumulator and the whole flag byte poisoned at the instant of the
 *      hand-off, is still identical to the oracle. The same probe with the RECORD POINTER poisoned
 *      instead IS caught, which is what stops the first half from being inert.
 *   6. LIVE (whole attract) — the candidate wired at 0x2079 for a 6000-frame attract run; the
 *      frame trace must be identical to the all-oracle baseline. The oracle's own four
 *      instructions are charged back inside the override (the tail chain's cycles are NOT — the
 *      candidate runs that chain itself, so charging the full oracle cost would double-count).
 *   7. LIVE TEETH — the same run without that charge, to show the charge is load-bearing.
 *   8. TEETH — five broken twins the gate MUST catch.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-2079.test.js
