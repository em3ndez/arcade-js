 * Equivalence test for seedSpriteObjectPair (ROM 0x11a6) — seed a pair of object
 * records from ROM templates, mark both active, and emit their two hardware sprite
 * records (a four-step orchestrator over copyBytePairsStrided / replicateGroupStrided
 * / gatherSpriteRecords).
 *
 * sub_11a6 WRITES memory (the two object records at 0x6680–0x669a and the two sprite
 * records at 0x6A18–0x6A1F) and takes an implicit live-in HL (the caller's ROM position
 * table), so it is validated by capture/clone/replay on a FRESH clone per case — never
 * by reusing one machine, and never on the full register file, cycles, SP or PC. The
 * contract compared is RAM (minus STACK_SCRATCH) only: LIVE-OUT is memory-only (all
 * three call sites reload HL/DE/BC and branch on no flag right after the call, so every
 * register/flag left here is dead ABI — see the routine header).
 *
 *   1. REALISM — hook 0x11a6 in a real attract run and clone the machine at each real
 *      dispatch. Attract's 25m board build reaches exactly the first call site
 *      (HL=0x3E0C via loc_0fd7). For each, run oracle vs seedSpriteObjectPair on two
 *      fresh clones and confirm identical RAM (ex-stack).
 *
 *   2. CRAFTED — attract only exercises the HL=0x3E0C site, so poke a real capture into
 *      the two sites it never reaches (HL=0x3E10 via loc_101f, HL=0x3E14 via loc_1131),
 *      identically on both sides, and a destination-prefill variant that seeds the whole
 *      object/sprite footprint with a sentinel first (so an incomplete/short write would
 *      surface). Every crafted state is applied to both sides, so any divergence is the
 *      rewrite's fault.
 *
 *   3. TEETH — a stride-transposition twin (swaps step 1's C=0x0e with step 2's C=0x0c,
 *      a copy-paste bug between the two near-identical setup calls) mis-places the second
 *      record's fields and MUST be caught, on the real capture and on a prefilled craft.
 *
 * NOT COMPARED, deliberately: SP, PC, cycles, and the full register file (docs/decompiler-pipeline). The
 * oracle's `ret` and internal `call`s move SP/PC and the cycle counter; the idiomatic
 * layer drops that model (the JS call stack replaces it). Its callees' stray stores land
 * only in STACK_SCRATCH (SP=0x6bec in the real capture), which the RAM diff skips.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-11a6.test.js
