/**
 * Equivalence test for dispatchBoardCollision (ROM 0x286F) — the per-board collision
 * dispatcher: `ld a,(0x6227)` (BOARD), `push hl`, then vector through the 6-entry inline
 * jump table at ROM 0x2874 to that board's collision handler.
 *
 * The dissolved dispatchBoardCollision takes { iy, c, bounds } and selects the board arm by BOARD
 * (a local switch), returning the arm's { overlap, residue, stride, base } tuple; it opens no guest
 * stack. It is validated by MEMORY-equivalence against the frozen oracle (RAM − STACK_SCRATCH) plus
 * that returned tuple against the four values the oracle leaves in A/B/E/IX. pc/SP are seam
 * artifacts of the oracle's rst-0x28 trampoline unwind and are not compared; the RAM diff excludes
 * the dead STACK_SCRATCH region. It IS reached in plain attract (BOARD holds 1, the 25m arm), so the
 * reached arm is covered by real captures; the other three arms (BOARD 2/3/4) are crafted.
 *
 *   1. REACHABILITY — 0x286f is dispatched during attract (the collision cascade calls it).
 *
 *   2. REALISM (captured attract dispatches) — hook 0x286f in attract and clone at each real
 *      dispatch. Run the ORACLE on one clone and dispatchBoardCollision on another and prove
 *      RAM(−stack) + the returned tuple identical — the FULL oracle handler runs on the oracle
 *      side, so a wrong input handoff or a wrong arm surfaces as divergent memory or tuple.
 *
 *   3. CRAFTED (the other three boards) — poke BOARD to 2/3/4 on a real captured state,
 *      identically on both sides, to run arms 0x28B0 / 0x28E0 / 0x2901 in full and prove the same
 *      contract for the arms attract never reaches.
 *
 *   4. SELECTOR — pin the board->arm map identity (boards 1-4) and that every other selector is a
 *      never-reached guard slot the dissolved dispatcher throws on.
 *
 *   5. TEETH — two broken twins, each MUST be caught:
 *      (a) a twin that ignores BOARD and always runs the 100m arm — caught on boards 2/3 by the
 *          full-handler contract (different array/count, different returned base).
 *      (b) a twin that corrupts the returned base — caught by the tuple's base field.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-286f.test.js
