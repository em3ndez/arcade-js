/**
 * Equivalence test for loc_2146 (ROM 0x2146) — the object re-launch arm ROM 0x2118 branches to
 * while the object's Y is still above the 0xE0 line: run the fixed-point subtract, re-seed the
 * object's two step fields, snapshot its Y into record byte +0x19, and enter the shared
 * zero-fill tail at ROM 0x2153 with the result register cleared.
 *
 * WHAT THIS GATE ACTUALLY COVERS, stated plainly:
 *
 *   1. REALISM (captured, ATTRACT ONLY). 0x2146 is reachable without input: hooking it through
 *      a plain 12000-frame attract run captured 34 real dispatches when this gate was written,
 *      at three different object records, and the demo produces TWO of the four velocity-source
 *      arms there (the level arm, mode latch clear; and the random arm, latch set at difficulty
 *      1). EVERY capture is replayed — there is no sampling — and the run prints the count and
 *      the arms seen, so a future narrowing of the demo shows up rather than hiding. Credited
 *      gameplay, boards 2/3/4 and two-player are NOT covered by this part.
 *
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted, on real captures). The two velocity-source arms attract never reaches —
 *      difficulty 3/4 and difficulty 5 — are driven by poking the mode latch and DIFFICULTY on a
 *      real captured entry, together with a LEVEL sweep through the mode-latch-clear arm. The
 *      crafted entries are proved NON-VACUOUS: the test asserts on the ORACLE side that the five
 *      difficulties really do land on three different sources (the random arm and the toward-
 *      player arms write distinguishable record bytes) and that the level arm's magnitude byte
 *      actually changes with LEVEL. Each dispatched arm is exhaustively proven by its own gate;
 *      this one proves only that this routine reaches them unchanged.
 *
 *   3. EQUAL (crafted, exhaustive over the snapshotted byte). The routine's own memory effect is
 *      a copy of record +0x05 into +0x19, so that byte is swept over all 256 values on a real
 *      captured entry. The sweep deliberately includes values at or above 0xE0, which the
 *      CALLER's gate would have diverted to its own arm — this routine does not test the byte,
 *      so the full range is the honest input space for it.
 *
 *   4. TEETH — five broken twins, each of which the suite MUST catch:
 *      (a) dropped snapshot          — +0x19 never written.
 *      (b) snapshot from +0x04       — the neighbouring record byte instead of OBJ_Y.
 *      (c) snapshot written to +0x18 — one byte low.
 *      (d) dropped velocity seed     — loc_22cb never called.
 *      (e) tail entered uncleared    — the snapshot value handed to ROM 0x2153 instead of zero.
 *
 * CONTRACT: RAM MINUS STACK_SCRATCH [0x6BE0,0x6C00), plus the propagated return value. Both
 * sides run the WHOLE tail chain (0x2153 -> 0x21BA -> the 0x1F72 object loop), so a wrong byte
 * anywhere along it surfaces in the diff. The oracle's two dissolved call brackets (for ROM
 * 0x2407 and ROM 0x22CB) land inside the excluded stack region, and the test MEASURES that the
 * exclusion is load-bearing: it counts the replays whose only difference is inside it and
 * asserts the count is non-zero (28 of 34 when written). pc is NOT compared — the rewrite is
 * cycle-free and does not maintain it. The return value IS asserted, but it propagates as
 * `undefined` on every path observed here, so that assertion is weak on its own and the RAM diff
 * is what carries this gate.
 *
 * ROM 0x2153 is still the frozen oracle on BOTH sides (it is being decompiled in the same batch),
 * so this gate says nothing about it beyond the register value handed to it — which twin (e)
 * pins.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/dkong/idiomatic/test/equivalence-2146.test.js
