/**
 * Memory-equivalence gate for advanceActorMovers (ROM 0x3a13) — the two-sprite actor's
 * late-phase per-frame update: advance the primary object record (and, when its gate is
 * set, the twin record) through the shared move/collision driver, then stage both sprite
 * records.
 *
 * CONTRACT. The declared live-out is MEMORY-ONLY — the advanced record(s) plus the two
 * staged sprite records. The routine is reached by tail-jump and its callees (the move
 * driver, the sprite-staging tail) leave no register a caller reads, so the gate compares
 * work RAM (dumpState) and excludes the Z80 pc/SP/value-registers the honest rewrite does
 * not preserve. It also excludes the dead top-of-stack scratch the oracle's driver call
 * parks just below the entry stack pointer — the stack-free idiomatic JS does not write it.
 *
 * TWO INPUT SOURCES.
 *   - REAL captured attract dispatches. The demo runs the actor's PRIMARY record through
 *     here many hundreds of times, so the primary copy-in / drive / copy-back is exercised
 *     on real data. But the second-record gate (0x8078) is 0 for ALL of attract, so the
 *     twin path is never taken by a real capture.
 *   - A CRAFTED entry. A real captured state is poked (identically on both sides) to set
 *     the gate nonzero, which forces the twin record through the driver too — the path
 *     attract does not reach (mirrors the offset poke in the 0x3a4c gate).
 *
 * WRINKLE — the move driver's arrival / capture tails can hand off to the round/state
 * boundary transition, which converges at two TRUE oracle leaves (0x031a, 0x01f9) that
 * never return on hardware (they busy-wait on the vblank NMI, which never fires on a
 * single-routine clone). Both arms reach the same leaves, so the gate stubs them
 * identically on both clones and models the once-per-frame interrupt tick their
 * frame-waits drain, so any such tail terminates the same way on both sides.
 *
 * Checks:
 *   0. HARNESS — capture real 0x3a13 attract dispatches; the oracle run is deterministic.
 *   1. EQUAL (real dispatches) — advanceActorMovers == oracle over RAM on every captured
 *      entry; the primary record really was advanced.
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted twin) — with the gate poked nonzero on both sides, the twin record
 *      is driven too and idiomatic still matches; the twin record really was advanced.
 *   3. TEETH (dropped copy-back) — a twin that drives the primary record but forgets to
 *      write the stepped result back is CAUGHT in the primary record.
 *   4. TEETH (skipped second record) — a twin that ignores the gate and never advances the
 *      twin is INVISIBLE at gate 0 (so the crafted entry is load-bearing) and CAUGHT in the
 *      twin record once the gate is poked nonzero.
 *
