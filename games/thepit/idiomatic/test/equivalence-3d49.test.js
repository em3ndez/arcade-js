/**
 * Observable-equivalence gate for loc_3d49 (ROM 0x3d49, The Pit) — the fixed-panel
 * painter: it names one tile cell (column 1, row 12), asks the shared address
 * helpers for that cell's tilemap offset and colour-RAM / video-RAM cursors, then
 * stamps a nine-cell vertical panel (a live work-RAM value on top, an eight-glyph
 * label below) and hands off to the colour-column filler.
 *
 * WHY THIS ROUTINE IS INTERESTING FOR THE GATE:
 *
 *   1. It is entered only during screen setup, which attract does reach — but late
 *      and rarely (0x3d49 dispatches at frame 61, then not again until ~1914). So a
 *      REAL captured dispatch is available: the harness runs a boot and snapshots the
 *      genuine frame-61 entry, no crafted forcing needed.
 *
 *   2. Three of its helpers are now decompiled and called directly by name
 *      (rowColToTileOffset 0x3dae, deriveTileWriteCursors 0x3dc9, and the colour tail
 *      fillColourColumn 0x3e01). The two glyph-stamping helpers (0x3dea for the live
 *      value, 0x3ddb for the ROM label) are still the frozen oracle, reached through
 *      the registry — both the oracle and the idiomatic routine run the identical
 *      callee for those two, so the gate only tests loc_3d49's own layout writes,
 *      its routing, and that the direct calls reproduce the helpers' RAM effects.
 *
 *   3. THE CONTRACT IS OBSERVABLE-MEMORY EQUIVALENCE. Dissolving the 0x3dae / 0x3dc9
 *      calls and the 0x3e01 tail-jump into direct JS calls removes the Z80 return-
 *      address pushes and the tail-jump's final `ret`, so the idiomatic routine no
 *      longer drives pc / SP the way the oracle does, and the two dead stack-scratch
 *      bytes just below the entry stack pointer are no longer modelled here. The gate
 *      therefore compares the work / colour / video RAM the routine actually paints,
 *      EXCLUDING that [SP-2, SP) scratch window, and lines pc + SP up by doing one
 *      ret() on the candidate (the oracle rets internally via the tail-jump; the
 *      idiomatic routine returns in plain JS). Value registers are the declared-dead
 *      live-out and are not part of the contract.
 *
 *   4. Its one state-dependent input is the live value at 0x8000 (copied into the top
 *      cell). Attract leaves it 0, so the real entry is swept over a range of values
 *      to exercise that input beyond what attract produces.
 *
 * EQUAL is proven on the real frame-61 entry and across a 0x8000 sweep; the teeth
 * twins (wrong colour, an off-by-one label pointer that only surfaces in video RAM,
 * and a DROPPED deriveTileWriteCursors call that proves the dissolved direct call is
 * load-bearing) are all caught.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/thepit/idiomatic/test/equivalence-3d49.test.js
