/**
 * Memory-equivalence gate for stampFixedFrameAndResolveTile (ROM 0x186a) — the thin frame-prologue that stamps a
 * fixed animation frame code into the actor's sprite-frame byte and then hands off to the
 * shared position/tile tail resolveObjectTile.
 *
 * The routine's declared live-out is MEMORY-ONLY: the sprite-frame byte it writes plus
 * everything the shared tail writes. It has no live registers of its own, so the gate compares
 * RAM only (dumpState), never the Z80 pc/SP/register/cycle trace the idiomatic layer drops.
 *
 * THE STACK SCRATCH. stampFixedFrameAndResolveTile's own tail is now dissolved: where the frozen oracle hands off to
 * the shared tail through a stack-threaded jump, the idiomatic arm calls the already-idiomatic,
 * stack-free tail resolveObjectTile directly. The two therefore leave different dead bytes just below the
 * entry stack pointer (The Pit's stack is real diffed work RAM, entry SP ~0x83fd here) — classic
 * dead scratch the oracle's deeper call chain parks and the stack-free idiomatic never writes,
 * overwritten by the caller's next push before anything reads it. The diff excludes exactly that
 * [SP-8, SP) window and compares everything else byte-for-byte; the real outputs all sit far
 * below the stack (the sprite-frame byte 0x8069 plus the tail's 0x80xx/video-RAM writes), so the
 * window can never hide one — the teeth confirm it.
 *
 * A WRINKLE THE TEETH HANDLE. The frame the routine stamps is a DEFAULT: on almost every tile
 * the tail's classifier recomputes the actor frame and overwrites 0x8069, so the stamp is dead
 * (memory-equivalent whatever value it held). Across a full attract run the stamp survives on
 * exactly 1 of ~521 dispatches — the state where the tile routes past the classifier. So the
 * gate takes teeth from two directions: a twin that skips the tail hand-off entirely (caught by
 * the tail's own writes, which fire on every entry), and a wrong-frame twin replayed on that one
 * real captured state where the stamp survives (caught at the sprite-frame byte).
 *
 * The entries are REAL: 0x186a is dispatched by the movement/state dispatcher during the attract
 * demo, so the gate captures those live states via the registry hook and replays each in
 * isolation — no crafting required, including the survive-state used for the frame teeth.
 *
 * Four checks:
 *   0. HARNESS  — capture real 0x186a dispatches from attract; confirm the oracle run is
 *      deterministic (oracle vs oracle over one entry -> identical RAM).
 *   1. EQUAL    — stampFixedFrameAndResolveTile == oracle over RAM across every captured entry; and on the one entry
 *      where the stamp survives, the idiomatic run leaves the chosen frame code (52).
 *   2. TEETH    — a twin that skips the shared-tail hand-off is CAUGHT (the tail's writes are
 *      missing), proving the delegation half of the routine is under the gate.
 *   3. TEETH    — a wrong-frame twin (stamps 53), replayed on the real survive-state, is CAUGHT
 *      at the sprite-frame byte, proving the stamp half is under the gate where it is observable.
 *
