/**
 * Memory-equivalence gate for awardTwentyPoints (ROM 0x4683) — the +20 score-award entry:
 * it plays the score sound (command 16) and hands a packed-decimal +20 to the shared
 * score adder, which bumps the active player's two-byte score and repaints the digits.
 *
 * WHY CRAFTED-ENTRY. The attract demo never awards +20 — 0x4683 is never dispatched or
 * m.call'd across a 1400-frame attract run (the demo scores through other sources).
 * unitEquivalence, which captures the machine at a real dispatch of the target, therefore
 * cannot reach it; test 0 pins that down. So the gate instead captures real attract states
 * (at the per-frame service) and runs 0x4683's entry from them, with the active-player mode
 * byte poked identically on both sides to reach each path — the crafted-entry technique for
 * an arm attract never runs.
 *
 * THE CONTRACT is memory-equivalence, not the full register file: RAM outside the dead
 * stack scratch, ALONE. The declared live-out is memory-only — the packed-decimal score
 * bytes, the repainted digit cells, and the queued sound command — so pc, SP, and the
 * value registers and flags the oracle leaves behind are excluded. The dissolve replaced
 * the oracle's fall-into-and-tail-jump of the shared adder with a direct addScore(m, 0x0020)
 * call, so the idiomatic award leaves pc at its entry value and SP below the oracle's; that
 * is the routine's dead ABI, not its live-out, and is not compared.
 *
 * THE STACK SCRATCH. The oracle's own return-address push plus the sound routine's two
 * register saves leave six dead bytes just below the entry stack pointer that the
 * stack-lean idiomatic path does not reproduce. Both sides then run the identical shared
 * adder and digit repaint, so that six-byte window [entrySP-6, entrySP) is the only benign
 * difference — it is excluded, and every real write (score, digits, sound ring) lands well
 * above it.
 *
 * Six checks:
 *   0. UNREACHED — unitEquivalence cannot capture 0x4683 in attract (never entered),
 *      which is exactly why the gate is crafted-entry rather than real-dispatch.
 *   1. IDENTITY — the crafted-entry harness reports EQUAL when both arms are the oracle,
 *      proving it can report equal (a gate that never does is worthless in the other
 *      direction).
 *   2. EQUAL (active-player add path) — with the mode byte forced active (1, then 2),
 *      idiomatic == oracle over the contract; the score gains packed-decimal 20 and the
 *      sound ring slot holds command 16 (pending).
 *   3. EQUAL (inactive skip path) — with the mode byte forced inactive (0, then 3),
 *      idiomatic == oracle; the score is untouched but the sound is still queued.
 *   4. TEETH (wrong sound / wrong increment) — a twin that queues the wrong sound
 *      command, and one that adds +10 instead of +20, are both CAUGHT.
 *   5. TEETH (dropped add) — a twin that plays the sound but never adds to the score is
 *      CAUGHT at the score byte.
 *
