/**
 * Memory-equivalence gate for requestSound7 (ROM 0x4c6b) — the sound-trigger stub
 * that requests command 7 by delegating to the shared sound-ring enqueue.
 *
 * The stub's distinctive job is a single number: it queues command index 7, which the
 * shared enqueue marks pending (high bit) and stores into the ring slot at SOUND_HEAD
 * before advancing that pointer (wrapping after the eighth slot). Its declared live-out
 * is MEMORY-ONLY — the filled ring slot and advanced pointer — so the gate compares
 * RAM + pc + SP, NOT the value registers (the honest-signature contract). No caller
 * reads the command byte or flags the oracle path leaves in registers.
 *
 * WRINKLE 1 (unreached arm): command 7 is NEVER requested during attract, so 0x4c6b is
 * never dispatched in a boot run — the target-hooking harness cannot capture it. That is
 * the doc-sanctioned "unreached arm" case: capture a REAL machine state at a proxy leaf
 * that IS reached (0x3dae, the (row,col)->tilemap-offset calc, entered early in attract
 * and never a caller of 0x4c6b, so its capture hook cannot re-enter this stub), then run
 * the stub on that real state with the ring write pointer swept across all eight slots —
 * a surgical, identical-both-sides nudge that exercises every ring slot and the wrap.
 *
 * WRINKLE 2 (dead stack scratch): the oracle path saves and restores two register pairs
 * on the stack, and The Pit's stack is real diffed work RAM (0x83ff downward). Those
 * pushes leave four dead bytes just below the entry stack pointer that the stack-free
 * idiomatic JS (delegating to the decompiled enqueue) never reproduces — classic dead
 * stack scratch, overwritten by the caller's own next push before anything reads them —
 * so the RAM diff excludes exactly that [SP-4, SP) window and compares everything else.
 * The oracle path rets internally (its enqueue tail unwinds to this stub's caller); the
 * candidate models that return with one m.ret() so pc + SP line up.
 *
 * Checks:
 *   1. EQUAL (real states, all ring slots) — over several captured proxy entries and
 *      every ring write pointer 0..7, oracle and requestSound7 leave identical RAM
 *      (outside the stack scratch) + pc + SP, and the slot ends up holding 0x87
 *      (7 | pending bit) with the pointer advanced/wrapped.
 *   2. POSITIVE (the enqueue really happened) — with SOUND_HEAD pinned to slots 0/3/7,
 *      requestSound7 writes 0x87 into exactly that ring slot and advances the pointer,
 *      wrapping after the eighth. Proves the gate tests a real effect, not a no-op.
 *   3. TEETH — a twin that requests the WRONG command (6, a real neighbour's payload)
 *      MUST be caught at the ring slot (0x86 instead of 0x87). An always-EQUAL gate is
 *      worthless.
 *
