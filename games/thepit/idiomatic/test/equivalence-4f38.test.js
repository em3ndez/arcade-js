/**
 * Memory-equivalence gate for loc_4f38 (ROM 0x4f38) — steps an object's cyclic index up
 * one notch and requests sound 8.
 *
 * The index is either DISENGAGED (the off value 255) or ENGAGED in the range 10..35.
 * Stepping up rolls the disengaged value over to re-enter the range at 10, and stepping
 * past the top of the range (above 35) disengages back to 255. The routine's genuine
 * inputs/outputs are: the index in (a register live-in) and the new index out (a register
 * live-out the caller reads), plus a memory side effect — sound command 8 dropped into the
 * sound ring. So the gate is the honest-signature contract: RAM (outside the transient
 * stack scratch) + pc + SP, PLUS the returned index (the register-C live-out), NOT the dead
 * value registers/flags the oracle leaves behind.
 *
 * WHY A CRAFTED ENTRY. This routine requests sound command 8, and attract never requests
 * command 8 (a probe over thousands of frames sees 0 dispatches of it), so loc_4f38 is
 * never reached in a boot/attract run — the capture/replay harness cannot hook it directly.
 * Per the crafted-entry method the gate instead runs it from a REAL captured sound-request
 * state: the sibling sound stub 0x4c57 (command 2) IS reached during attract and shares the
 * same call convention, so its entry (a valid stack with a return address, an in-play ring
 * pointer) is a faithful state to run loc_4f38 from. 0x4f38 never calls 0x4c57, so cloning
 * that entry introduces no registry recursion. The one input that shapes the index output —
 * the incoming index — is then swept EXHAUSTIVELY over all 256 values identically on both
 * sides, pinning the roll-over and the disengage boundaries.
 *
 * THE STACK SCRATCH. The Pit's stack is real diffed work RAM (0x83ff down). The oracle
 * pushes its own return address and the shared enqueue tail saves two register pairs — up
 * to six dead bytes parked just below the entry stack pointer that the stack-free idiomatic
 * never writes (classic dead stack scratch, overwritten by the caller's next push before
 * anything reads it). So the RAM diff excludes the [SP-8, SP) window and compares everything
 * else byte-for-byte. The idiomatic models its return as a plain JS return, so the contract
 * does one m.ret() on the candidate after the call to line pc + SP up with the oracle (which
 * rets internally).
 *
 * SIX checks:
 *   0. HARNESS — capture a real 0x4c57 sound-request entry and confirm the oracle run of
 *      loc_4f38 is deterministic (oracle vs oracle -> identical whole state). Proves the
 *      capture/clone/diff plumbing reaches a real sound-request state.
 *   1. EQUAL (real entry) — loc_4f38 == oracle over RAM + pc + SP + the new index, and the
 *      ring slot holds sound-8-pending with the pointer advanced.
 *   2. EQUAL (exhaustive index sweep 0..255) — for every incoming index, both leave identical
 *      state and hand back the same new index; the roll-over (255 -> 10), the disengage
 *      (>35 -> 255), and the plain in-range step are all exercised.
 *   3. TEETH (roll-over target) — a twin that re-enters the range at 11 instead of 10 is
 *      CAUGHT on the index live-out (the routine's core payload).
 *   4. TEETH (wrong sound) — a twin that requests command 7 instead of 8 is CAUGHT at the
 *      ring slot by the RAM diff.
 *
