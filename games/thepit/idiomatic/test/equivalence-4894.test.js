/**
 * Memory-equivalence gate for drawCreditsDisplay (ROM 0x4894, The Pit) — a fixed-panel
 * painter: it names one tile cell (column 6, row 10), asks the shared address
 * helpers for that cell's tilemap offset and colour-RAM / video-RAM cursors, then
 * stamps a panel (a live work-RAM value on top, an eight-glyph label below) and
 * tail-calls the colour-column filler.
 *
 * THIS GATE IS OBSERVABLE EQUIVALENCE (after the stale-call dissolve). Three of
 * drawCreditsDisplay's layout helpers are now decompiled and called directly as ordinary JS —
 * rowColToTileOffset (0x3dae), deriveTileWriteCursors (0x3dc9) and fillColourColumn
 * (0x3e01, the tail). A direct JS call has no Z80 stack frame, so the routine no longer
 * pushes those three return addresses. Two consequences the gate now models instead of
 * demanding byte-identity of:
 *
 *   - the dead stack-scratch slot just below the entry stack pointer (where a dissolved
 *     CALL parked its return address) is no longer written by drawCreditsDisplay itself, so it is
 *     EXCLUDED from the RAM diff — classic dead scratch (re-covered by the caller's next
 *     push before anything reads it). Here it is in fact re-covered by the two copy/fill
 *     helpers that STAY the oracle (0x3dea, 0x3ddb), so the window matches too; excluding
 *     it is the principled dead-scratch treatment, not a diff being hidden.
 *   - the exit pc + SP: the oracle's tail 0x3e01 rets into drawCreditsDisplay's caller (SP += 2),
 *     while the stack-free idiomatic routine plain-returns. The gate models that tail
 *     return with ONE m.ret() on the candidate, which lines pc + SP up with the oracle
 *     exactly — so pc + SP are still checked, not waived.
 *
 * The two copy/fill helpers (0x3dea, 0x3ddb) are STILL the frozen oracle, reached
 * through the registry on both sides, so the gate is only testing drawCreditsDisplay's own layout
 * writes, its routing, and the two still-oracle calls' IX-source + stack-return marshalling.
 *
 * WHY THIS ROUTINE IS INTERESTING FOR THE GATE:
 *
 *   1. It is entered from the movement core's periodic housekeeping (loc_03e8 calls
 *      it when a counter hits zero), which attract does reach — but only once, late
 *      (~frame 675). So a REAL captured dispatch is available: the harness runs a
 *      boot/attract and snapshots the genuine entry, no crafted forcing needed.
 *
 *   2. Its one state-dependent input is the live value at 0x8000 (copied into the top
 *      cell). Attract leaves it 0, so the real entry is swept over a range of values
 *      to exercise that input beyond what attract produces.
 *
 *   3. The behaviour that distinguishes it from its siblings: it does NOT reset the
 *      cell count to nine before the tail, so the colour fill covers eight cells, not
 *      nine. A teeth twin that restores the count-of-nine (the sibling behaviour) must
 *      be caught.
 *
 * EQUAL is proven on the real captured entry and across a 0x8000 sweep (observable RAM
 * outside the dead stack slot, plus pc + SP after the modelled return); the teeth twins
 * (wrong colour, an off-by-one label pointer that only surfaces in video RAM, a
 * count-of-nine colour run) are all caught at observable cells.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/thepit/idiomatic/test/equivalence-4894.test.js
