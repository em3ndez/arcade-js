/**
 * Memory-equivalence gate for blankScreen (ROM 0x4b44) — the mode-0 door of the
 * display-setup fan-in.
 *
 * blankScreen stows board-mode 0 at BOARD_MODE and blanks the screen for setup in four
 * fixed-region steps: clear sprite/attribute RAM, fill the tilemap, flat-fill colour
 * RAM with the board-mode byte, and wipe the sprite-staging work block. All four
 * callees are already decompiled, so the idiomatic rewrite calls them directly and
 * models the original's tail-jump into the staging wipe as a JS return.
 *
 * The gate is MEMORY-ONLY. The oracle marshals its three intermediate calls on the
 * Z80 stack (which lives in diffed work RAM near 0x83ff), leaving a two-byte return-
 * address residue just below the entry stack pointer that the stack-free idiomatic JS
 * never writes. That residue is classic dead stack scratch (the caller overwrites it
 * before any read), so the RAM diff excludes exactly the window just below the entry
 * SP and compares every other byte — work, colour, video and sprite/attribute RAM —
 * byte for byte. pc and SP are excluded too: the idiomatic layer does not preserve the
 * Z80 return trace, and a strict pc/SP contract would break the moment a callee is
 * later dissolved.
 *
 * Five checks:
 *   0. HARNESS — capture a real 0x4b44 dispatch in a boot/attract run and confirm the
 *      oracle run is deterministic (oracle vs oracle identical). Proves the capture/
 *      clone/replay plumbing reaches 0x4b44 at all.
 *   1. EQUAL (real dispatches) — idiomatic == oracle over RAM (outside the stack
 *      scratch) on every captured entry: same blanked screen, no stray writes.
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted dirty screen) — pre-seed colour / video / sprite / staging RAM
 *      with a sentinel on both sides; both blank them identically, and the idiomatic
 *      run really replaced the sentinel (non-vacuous: proves the fills/clears run, not
 *      that the screen was already blank).
 *   3. TEETH (wrong board-mode byte) — a twin that stows 0xC0 instead of 0 is CAUGHT
 *      at BOARD_MODE / the colour RAM it flat-fills.
 *   4. TEETH (skipped staging wipe) — a twin that omits the tail wipe leaves a dirtied
 *      staging block, CAUGHT at 0x8200; proves the tail step actually runs.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/thepit/idiomatic/test/equivalence-4b44.test.js
