/**
 * Memory-equivalence gate for awardOnePoint (ROM 0x4673) — the "+1 point" score award:
 * it plays the one-point pickup sound, then hands an increment of one to the shared BCD
 * scorer (still the frozen oracle at 0x4689), which folds it into the two-byte score
 * counter and repaints the four on-screen score digits for the active player.
 *
 * The award's whole effect is memory: the pending sound command lands in the ring slot at
 * SOUND_HEAD (pointer advanced), and — when the game-mode gate is active — the score bytes
 * at 0x8031/0x8034 gain one BCD point and the digit tiles in video RAM are rewritten. Its
 * declared live-out is MEMORY-ONLY, so the gate compares that observable RAM effect ALONE.
 * The dissolve replaced the oracle's m.call(0x4689) tail-jump with a direct addScore(m, 1)
 * call, so the idiomatic award leaves pc at its entry value and SP below the oracle's; those
 * are the routine's dead ABI, not its live-out, and are NOT compared (pc, SP, value regs).
 *
 * WHY A CRAFTED ENTRY. Attract never awards a point, so 0x4673 is never dispatched — the
 * capture/replay harness cannot hook it directly. Per the crafted-entry method the gate
 * instead runs the award from a REAL captured sound-request state: the sibling sound stub
 * 0x4c57 (command 2) IS reached during attract, and it leaves a faithful machine state —
 * a valid stack with a return address, an in-play sound-ring pointer, real score bytes.
 * The one input that steers the scorer — the game-mode gate at GAME_STATE — is then swept
 * across active (1,2 → add) and idle (0,3 → skip) identically on both sides.
 *
 * ONE WRINKLE — the oracle award routes its sound through the shared enqueue, which parks
 * two register pairs and a return address on the stack (The Pit's stack is real diffed work
 * RAM, 0x83ff down). Those pushes leave dead bytes just below the entry stack pointer that
 * the stack-free idiomatic sound call does not reproduce; they are classic dead stack scratch
 * (overwritten by the caller's next push before anything reads them), so the RAM diff excludes
 * exactly that window below the entry stack pointer and compares everything else byte-for-byte.
 * The idiomatic award writes nothing in that window, so the exclusion cannot mask a real bug.
 *
 * Six checks:
 *   0. HARNESS — capture a real 0x4c57 sound-request entry and confirm the oracle run of
 *      0x4673 is deterministic (oracle vs oracle -> identical whole state, same pc).
 *   1. EQUAL (real entry) — awardOnePoint == oracle over the observable RAM (outside the
 *      stack scratch), and the pending sound really queued.
 *   2. EQUAL (game-mode sweep 0..3) — with GAME_STATE forced active (1,2) and idle (0,3),
 *      both arms match; the score gains exactly one point when active and is untouched when
 *      idle, confirming both scorer branches run identically.
 *   3. TEETH (wrong increment) — with the scorer active, a twin that adds TWO points is
 *      CAUGHT at the score low byte (the increment is the award's payload).
 *   4. TEETH (wrong sound) — a twin that queues command 12 instead of 13 is CAUGHT at the
 *      ring slot (an unrelated sound would play).
