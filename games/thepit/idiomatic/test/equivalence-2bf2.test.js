/**
 * Memory-equivalence gate for startNextDigSpawn (ROM 0x2bf2, The Pit) — start the next queued
 * dig-object spawn, or clear the spawn-active flag when the 24-slot queue at 0x80c3 is
 * empty. Occupied queue -> tail-call the placement path loc_2c04; empty queue -> clear
 * SPAWN_STATE (0x80bd) and tail-call the background/terrain animation loc_2f71.
 *
 * WHY THE CONTRACT IS RAM-ONLY (outside a stack window). The occupied hand-off is the
 * already-decompiled spawnPendingDigObject; the empty hand-off (0x2f71) is the decompiled
 * advanceBackgroundSprite, called directly. The oracle startNextDigSpawn leaves its scan's pointer-walk
 * in the registers and the placement chain saves register pairs on the stack; the
 * stack-free idiomatic path does not reproduce those exact saved bytes, so a few dead
 * bytes just below the entry stack pointer differ (pushed, popped, and never read
 * before their slots are overwritten). Those are classic dead stack scratch, so the
 * diff excludes a small window below the entry SP — measured transient depth is 6
 * bytes, and every real work-RAM write on this path sits at or below 0x8239, far from
 * that window — and compares all other RAM byte-for-byte. pc/SP/value-registers are the
 * declared-dead live-out and are not compared (the idiomatic layer does not preserve
 * the Z80 trace).
 *
 * WHICH ARM EACH CHECK EXERCISES. startNextDigSpawn is dispatched during attract (reached from
 * loc_29ad's "no spawn active -> go spawn one" path), and in every real dispatch the
 * queue is populated, so real captures cover the OCCUPIED path (loc_2c04). The empty
 * path is never reached naturally, so it is covered by a CRAFTED entry: a real captured
 * state with the whole queue zeroed identically on both sides.
 *
 * Checks:
 *   0. HARNESS — capture a real 0x2bf2 dispatch and confirm the oracle run is
 *      deterministic (oracle vs oracle identical outside the stack window). Also
 *      documents that the real capture is the occupied path.
 *   1. EQUAL (real occupied entry) — startNextDigSpawn == oracle over RAM (outside the stack
 *      window); positive check that the placement path ran (spawn-active flag raised).
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted empty queue) — with the whole queue zeroed on both sides, both
 *      clear the spawn-active flag and hand off to the animation, byte-for-byte
 *      identical (no stack difference on this arm).
 *   3. TEETH (empty path) — a twin that leaves the spawn-active flag wrong is CAUGHT at
 *      0x80bd.
 *   4. TEETH (occupied path) — a twin that ignores the queue and always takes the empty
 *      path is CAUGHT (it misses the spawn: the flag stays 0 and the placement work is
 *      absent).
 *
