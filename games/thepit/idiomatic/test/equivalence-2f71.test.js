/**
 * Memory-equivalence gate for advanceZonker (ROM 0x2f71, The Pit) — the per-frame
 * monolith that steps the animated background sprite (sideways bounce + accelerating
 * fall + shimmer flip), publishes its screen-relative sprite record, reveals one column
 * of terrain once the goal is reached, and tail-jumps into the object-record pass (0x312d).
 *
 * The routine is dispatched EVERY frame in attract, so its always-run arms (shimmer
 * clock, bounce, publish) are gated against real captured entry states: hook 0x2f71,
 * clone the machine at each dispatch, and run idiomatic-vs-oracle on the clones.
 *
 * Two things force crafted entries. (1) Attract never reaches the goal tile, so the
 * terrain-reveal stage and its reveal-sound trigger are never taken by a real capture;
 * a captured entry is poked (goal latch on, gate/cursor set) to drive the reveal, the
 * gate-skip, the cursor-exhausted skip, and the sound gate — identically on both sides.
 * (2) The floor clamp that draws a fresh random fall step is periodic; a captured entry
 * is poked to force the oscillator to run with Y at the floor so both sides advance the
 * shared PRNG in lockstep.
 *
 * ONE WRINKLE — the oracle path brackets its two internal calls (the reveal-sound
 * trigger 0x4c7b and the random generator 0x4b1a) with stack pushes, and The Pit's
 * stack is real diffed work RAM. Those pushes leave dead scratch just below the entry
 * stack pointer that the stack-free idiomatic JS (which calls those leaves directly)
 * does not reproduce. It is classic dead stack scratch — overwritten by the object-
 * record pass both sides run next, and never read before that — so the RAM diff excludes
 * a window just below the entry stack pointer and compares everything else byte-for-byte.
 * pc/SP are not compared: both sides reach the object-record pass (the idiomatic side
 * calls the decompiled updateEnemy1 directly, the oracle side m.calls the frozen
 * loc_312d — memory-equivalent), so excluding pc/SP keeps the gate independent of that
 * pass's exact stack trace.
 *
 * Checks:
 *   0. HARNESS — capture real 0x2f71 entries and confirm the oracle run is deterministic
 *      (oracle vs oracle → identical whole state incl. stack).
 *   1. EQUAL (real captured entries) — advanceZonker == oracle over RAM (outside the
 *      dead stack scratch) on every naturally-occurring attract state.
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted reveal) — goal latch on: full 6-tile reveal + reveal sound, the
 *      gate-not-yet-zero skip, and the cursor-exhausted skip all match the oracle.
 *   3. EQUAL (crafted floor clamp) — oscillator forced with Y at the floor: the clamp,
 *      the random fall-step reseed, and the colour bump match (PRNG stays in lockstep).
 *   4. TEETH (wrong published X) — a twin that corrupts the published X byte is CAUGHT.
 *   5. TEETH (dropped reveal tile) — a twin that corrupts a revealed video tile is CAUGHT.
 *   6. TEETH (dropped horizontal step) — a twin that fails to move X is CAUGHT at the
 *      sprite's X byte (a genuine logic bug, not a post-hoc poke).
 *
