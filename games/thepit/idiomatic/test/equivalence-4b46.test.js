/**
 * Memory-equivalence gate for setupBoardDisplay (ROM 0x4b46) — the shared display-setup
 * body of the three board-mode doors: it records the board-mode byte and rebuilds the
 * whole screen for it (clear sprites/columns, wipe the tilemap, flood the colour RAM
 * with that byte, blank the sprite-staging block).
 *
 * HONEST SIGNATURE. The board-mode byte arrives in a register (the door sets it), so the
 * idiomatic routine takes it as a plain parameter, setupBoardDisplay(m, boardMode); the
 * oracle reads it from the accumulator. The gate feeds BOTH the same value — the captured
 * accumulator on a real entry, a swept value on the crafted entries.
 *
 * CONTRACT — OBSERVABLE RAM ONLY. Declared live-out is memory-only, so the gate diffs
 * work + colour + video + attr/sprite RAM and nothing else — NOT pc, SP, or the value
 * registers/flags, which the idiomatic layer deliberately does not preserve (a strict
 * pc/SP contract would break the instant a callee is later dissolved). The one RAM
 * difference that is NOT a bug: the oracle's three internal setup CALLs each park a 2-byte
 * return frame in the stack-scratch just below the entry stack pointer; the stack-free
 * idiomatic JS never writes there, so the diff excludes exactly that [entrySP-2, entrySP)
 * window (dead scratch — overwritten before anything reads it).
 *
 * REACHABILITY. 0x4b46 is dispatched through the registry during cold boot: the 0xC0 door
 * (loc_4b3c) sets the byte and tail-calls it. The capture hook fires there, so the real
 * entry is genuine, mid-boot state.
 *
 * Checks:
 *   0. HARNESS — capture a real 0x4b46 entry and confirm the oracle run is deterministic.
 *   1. EQUAL (real entry) — setupBoardDisplay == oracle over observable RAM, and the
 *      positive checks hold (byte recorded, colour flooded, tilemap wiped, sprites and
 *      staging cleared).
 *   2. EQUAL (board-mode sweep 0..255) — with the byte forced to each value on both sides,
 *      the whole screen rebuild is identical. Exhaustive over the one input that shapes
 *      the output.
 *   3. TEETH (wrong board-mode byte) — a twin that records the complement is CAUGHT at
 *      BOARD_MODE (the byte drives both the mode latch and the flood colour).
 *   4. TEETH (skipped tilemap wipe, dirtied entry) — with the tilemap pre-dirtied to a
 *      sentinel on both sides, a twin that skips the video-RAM fill leaves the sentinel and
 *      is CAUGHT in video RAM.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/thepit/idiomatic/test/equivalence-4b46.test.js
