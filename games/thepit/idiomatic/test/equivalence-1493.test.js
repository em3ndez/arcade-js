/**
 * Memory-equivalence gate for stepObjectRowFlipped (ROM 0x1493) — step the tracked object the opposite
 * way along its move axis: derive its tile row and route on it, firing the dig one-shot at
 * the boundary row.
 *
 * Given the caller's position offset (register live-in, surfaced as `offset`), it either
 * defers the whole move (busy flag set) to the record builder stageObjectSpriteRecord, or
 * forces the object's sprite code (SPRITE_CODE), derives the tile row (OBJ_TILE_ROW) and
 * hands the step to the positioning front locateObjectCellCheckGoal — except at the boundary row with the
 * feature latch pending, where it consumes the latch (FEATURE_TILE_LATCH), clears the pending
 * dig spawn (SPAWN_STATE), arms the dig object's phase (DIG_OBJ_STATE) and builds its record
 * via stageDigObjectSpriteRecord. All three callees are already idiomatic, so stepObjectRowFlipped calls
 * them directly (the row is passed to locateObjectCellCheckGoal as an honest arg; nothing is marshalled through
 * registers). Its declared LIVE-OUT is MEMORY-ONLY.
 *
 * THE STACK SCRATCH. The comparison runs the still-frozen ORACLE stepObjectRowFlipped, whose tail-jumps
 * thread through the Z80 stack (m.call, plus register saves in the deeper still-oracle
 * tile-resolver / background handlers), against the stack-free idiomatic handoff chain. Any
 * dead bytes the oracle parks just below the entry stack pointer (The Pit's stack is real
 * diffed work RAM, entry SP ~0x83fd) are classic scratch — overwritten before anything reads
 * them. The diff excludes exactly that [SP-N, SP) window and compares everything else
 * byte-for-byte; every real output sits far below (0x8069..0x80e7 plus the sprite staging
 * buffer at 0x8220), so the window can never hide one — the teeth confirm it. Registers /
 * flags / pc / SP are excluded (the honest-signature contract); the offset live-in defaults to
 * the register so a no-arg call reproduces the oracle exactly.
 *
 * Attract dispatches stepObjectRowFlipped during the demo (62x / 4000 frames via this move arm): the
 * common step, plus one natural dig one-shot, so real captured dispatches drive those arms.
 * A CRAFTED entry drives the arm the demo never produces (the deferred arm, busy flag set) and
 * a deterministic boundary-row dig one-shot for the positive + teeth checks.
 *
 * Checks:
 *   0. IDENTITY (harness) — oracle vs oracle on a captured attract dispatch; proves the
 *      capture/clone/replay harness reaches 0x1493 in a real run.
 *   1. EQUAL (real dispatches) — every captured attract dispatch leaves identical state
 *      outside the stack scratch (common step + the natural dig one-shot).
 *   2. NON-VACUOUS — a real dispatch actually publishes the derived tile row; a no-op twin
 *      cannot pass.
 *   3. EQUAL (crafted deferred) — the busy flag set defers to the record builder, identical
 *      to the oracle.
 *   4. EQUAL (crafted boundary row, latch clear) — the boundary row without the feature latch
 *      continues through the positioning front, identical to the oracle.
 *   5. EQUAL (crafted dig one-shot) — the boundary row with the feature latch pending consumes
 *      the latch, clears the spawn state, arms the dig phase and builds the dig record,
 *      identical to the oracle.
 *   6. TEETH (tile row) — a twin that corrupts the published tile row is CAUGHT at OBJ_TILE_ROW.
 *   7. TEETH (dig arming) — on the dig one-shot, a twin that drops the dig-phase arming is
 *      CAUGHT at DIG_OBJ_STATE.
 *
