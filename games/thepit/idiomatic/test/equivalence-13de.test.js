/**
 * Memory-equivalence gate for advanceTrackedObject (ROM 0x13de) — the body of the per-frame object/state
 * dispatcher. It reads a chain of the tracked object's control bytes and hands the frame to
 * exactly one handler (defer/stage, do nothing, a carve prologue, a walk stepper, the control
 * step, the walk-forward continuation, or the tile-cell tail). It writes no RAM of its own.
 *
 * OBSERVABLE-EQUIVALENCE CONTRACT. Every effect is produced by the chosen handler; the caller
 * (the countdown gate) tail-jumps here and reads no register back, so the declared LIVE-OUT is
 * MEMORY-ONLY. The idiomatic routine calls the already-decompiled handlers directly, while the
 * still-frozen ORACLE reaches them by tail-jump through the Z80 registry. The oracle's handler
 * chain threads a few bytes through the stack, leaving dead scratch just below the entry stack
 * pointer (The Pit's stack is real diffed work RAM, ~0x83fd here) that the stack-free idiomatic
 * chain does not reproduce — measured at most 6 bytes on the real attract paths. The diff
 * excludes exactly that [SP-16, SP) window and compares everything else byte-for-byte; every
 * real output lives far below the stack (0x8000..0x813x, the sprite records at 0x8220+, video
 * RAM 0x9000+), so the window can never hide one — the teeth confirm it. pc, SP and the value
 * registers are excluded (the honest-signature contract).
 *
 * THE REGISTER LIVE-OUT. advanceTrackedObject loads the object's position-bias pair (the word at 0x806c)
 * into D and E before dispatching; the tile-cell tail reads the column bias from D and the
 * still-oracle position handlers (reached via the at-rest router routeIdleObjectByMoveCommand) read both bytes as
 * the object's move deltas. That is a genuine register boundary the idiomatic routine
 * reproduces — dropping the E half forks PLAYER_FACING on the control-step path.
 *
 * REACHABILITY. Attract dispatches five arms: nothing-active (388×), the control step (1429×),
 * the two walk steppers (217× / 119×), and the carve prologue (9× over 3000 frames). The other
 * six arms never occur in attract, so each is gated on a real captured DE-stage entry (active,
 * at rest, arm idle) with the one or two gate bytes that force it poked identically on both
 * sides — a real state with a surgical nudge.
 *
 * Checks:
 *   0. IDENTITY (harness) — capture real 0x13de dispatches in attract, confirm the reached arms
 *      appear, and confirm the oracle run is deterministic (oracle vs oracle -> identical).
 *   1. EQUAL (real dispatches) — every captured attract dispatch leaves identical state outside
 *      the stack scratch.
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted arms) — each of the six arms attract never reaches is forced from a real
 *      DE-stage entry and leaves identical state; the forced branch is confirmed non-vacuously.
 *   3. TEETH (dropped active guard) — a twin that drops the "no live object" guard and dispatches
 *      a dead object is CAUGHT on a nothing-active entry.
 *   4. TEETH (wrong walk handler) — a twin that routes a positive motion marker to the object
 *      walker instead of the player walk step is CAUGHT on a positive-marker entry.
 *
