/**
 * Memory-equivalence gate for drawMenLeftPanel (ROM 0x483a, The Pit) — the two-variant
 * panel painter: it names one tile cell (column 5), reads a live work-RAM byte to
 * pick a variant, turns that cell into its tilemap offset and colour-RAM / video-RAM
 * cursors, stamps a label (plus a live-value cell in the default variant), and paints
 * the run in one colour.
 *
 * WHY THE GATE IS A CRAFTED ENTRY (not a captured dispatch):
 *
 *   Attract never dispatches 0x483a — a boot run of hundreds of frames enters it
 *   zero times. It draws in a state attract does not reach, so there is no genuine
 *   0x483a entry to snapshot. The pipeline's answer for unreached code is the crafted
 *   entry: take a REAL machine state and force the routine onto it. Here the entry is
 *   captured at the sibling panel painter drawSetupCreditsPanel's genuine frame-61 attract dispatch
 *   — a real screen-setup moment where this panel-drawing subsystem's scratch and
 *   video RAM are live — and drawMenLeftPanel is then run directly on clones of it. The one
 *   input that steers the routine, the decision byte at 0x802b, is forced to each of
 *   its two arms IDENTICALLY on both sides, so any divergence is the rewrite's fault.
 *
 * WHY OBSERVABLE (not whole-dump) EQUIVALENCE:
 *
 *   drawMenLeftPanel used to marshal registers and push a return address before each of its
 *   address-setup / colour-fill helpers so those still-oracle callees found the return
 *   they expected on the machine stack. Three of those helpers are now decompiled
 *   (rowColToTileOffset 0x3dae, deriveTileWriteCursors 0x3dc9, fillColourColumn 0x3e01)
 *   and are called as plain JS — no stack frame, no pushed return address. The glyph
 *   copy helper at 0x3dea is still the oracle and keeps its call.
 *
 *   Because the decompiled helpers no longer push, the routine no longer reproduces
 *   the oracle's return-address pushes below the stack pointer, and — the oracle's tail
 *   returns through the colour filler, so it pops the caller's address while the plain
 *   JS tail-call does not — the exit pc and the stack pointer legitimately differ. The
 *   gate therefore compares the RAM the panel actually writes, EXCLUDING the dead
 *   stack-scratch window just below the entry stack pointer, and lines the exit up by
 *   running one ret() on the candidate so its pc + SP meet the oracle's internal ret.
 *   (In practice the excluded window matches anyway — the retained copy helper rewrites
 *   it last with the same value — but it is excluded on principle: the dissolved helpers
 *   no longer own those bytes.)
 *
 * WHAT IS PROVEN:
 *   EQUAL on the default variant (the realistic 0x802b == 0 plus a sweep of the live
 *   displayed value) and on the alternate variant (0x802b == 1) over RAM (outside the
 *   stack scratch) + pc + SP; IDENTITY (oracle vs oracle, whole dump); and TEETH — a
 *   wrong colour (direct scratch), an off-by-one label pointer that surfaces only
 *   downstream in video RAM, and a post-hoc output corruption — all caught. The teeth
 *   twins are written in the same dissolved form as the routine and change ONE thing,
 *   so the caught diff is precisely the bug, never a spurious stack difference.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/thepit/idiomatic/test/equivalence-483a.test.js
