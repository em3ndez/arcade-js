/**
 * Memory-equivalence gate for collectAlignedLootElseResolveTile (ROM 0x1515) — resolve the tile the object is sitting on:
 * collect a loot tile it has landed squarely on (score + remove it), otherwise hand the step to
 * the terrain resolver resolveObjectTerrainStep.
 *
 * Given the object's biased tile column (column; low 3 bits = the sub-tile offset) and its
 * tile-cell pointer (cellPtr; the tile under the object is at cellPtr, the cell ahead is the next
 * byte), it records the under tile as the saved-current / expected-tile, then either collects loot
 * (tile 58 -> +10; tiles 59..61 -> +20, gated by a one-shot latch and a dig-spawn guard) or, for
 * every non-collect case, delegates to resolveObjectTerrainStep. Its declared LIVE-OUT is MEMORY-ONLY.
 *
 * STACK-TOP WINDOW. Unlike resolveObjectTerrainStep (all tail-jumps, no pushing CALL), collectAlignedLootElseResolveTile's two loot awards
 * reach the score adder through the oracle's ordinary calls (0x467b / 0x4683), which push a return
 * address the stack-free idiomatic never writes. Measured: the oracle parks at most a handful of
 * dead bytes just below the entry stack pointer (SP=0x83fb, lowest write 0x83f3). So the diff
 * excludes a small [SP-16, SP) stack-top window — well above the real work RAM this routine writes
 * (its highest is the sprite record at 0x8223) — and compares everything else byte-for-byte. The
 * terrain-delegation paths push nothing, so they are compared with the window in force but never
 * touch it.
 *
 * CRAFTED ENTRIES. Attract never digs an object into this case (measured: 0 dispatches in 4000
 * frames), so the capture/replay harness cannot hook 0x1515 directly. Per the crafted-entry method
 * the gate runs it from REAL captured attract clones (valid stack, video RAM, object record) with
 * its inputs poked — and because the behaviour depends only on the under tile and the low 3 bits of
 * the column, the under tile is swept exhaustively across every sub-offset.
 *
 * Checks:
 *   0. HARNESS — confirm attract never dispatches 0x1515, and oracle-vs-oracle on a crafted entry
 *      is deterministic (the capture/clone/replay plumbing works on a real attract clone).
 *   1. EQUAL (real attract clones) — a representative terrain step over real captured states.
 *   2. EQUAL (under-tile sweep) — every under-tile id 0..255 across every sub-offset (aligned +
 *      off-grid): both loot kinds when aligned, and the terrain delegation everywhere else.
 *   3. EQUAL (loot paths) — tile 58; tiles 59..61 over the latch-armed / arm-now / guard-blocked
 *      branches; each matches the oracle, and the pickup count, latch, and blanked cell land as
 *      expected (or, when blocked, do not).
 *   4. NON-VACUOUS — a +10 collect really bumps the count and blanks the cell; a no-op twin cannot
 *      pass, and the real routine agrees with the oracle.
 *   5. TEETH (pickup count) — a twin that skips the +10 count bump is CAUGHT at LOOT_10PT_COUNT.
 *   6. TEETH (blank cell) — a twin that skips blanking the collected cell is CAUGHT at that cell.
 *
