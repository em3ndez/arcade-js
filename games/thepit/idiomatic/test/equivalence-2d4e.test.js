/**
 * Memory-equivalence gate for loc_2d4e (ROM 0x2d4e) — the "target landed on terrain" arm
 * of the descending-target handler. On a terrain hit it queues a sound, stamps the
 * finished-target tile into the map cell just ahead of the target, resets the target's
 * small state block (spawn gate → idle, target X → 0, state → done/target, attribute →
 * fixed colour), then tail-hands-off to the record builder at 0x2bd3.
 *
 * Its declared live-out is MEMORY-ONLY, so the gate compares RAM (outside the transient
 * stack scratch), not the value registers the oracle leaves behind (the honest-signature
 * contract). Both arms run the full downstream tail (0x2bd3 → 0x2f71 → …) off the SAME
 * cloned entry, so that shared work is identical on both sides and the diff isolates this
 * routine's own writes; the tail also confirms this routine seeds the block the builder
 * then reads.
 *
 * WHY A CRAFTED ENTRY. This arm is only reached when the descending target hits a specific
 * terrain tile, which attract never drives — and it requests sound-command 17, which the
 * attract loop never asks for (the sibling requestSound17 gate relies on exactly that), so
 * the capture harness cannot hook 0x2d4e directly. Per the crafted-entry method the gate
 * runs it from a REAL captured attract state (the tile-offset leaf 0x3dae, reliably reached
 * ~frame 81, gives a valid deep RAM + stack). The one input that shapes the tile stamp —
 * the target's map-cell pointer, which the still-oracle caller leaves in a register — is
 * placed at a known video-RAM cell identically on both sides. 0x2d4e never calls 0x3dae,
 * so cloning that entry introduces no registry recursion.
 *
 * WHY NO ENTROPY PIN. Both arms are the same engine run from a byte-identical clone, so the
 * downstream tail's RNG draws advance identically; the pin only matters when comparing
 * across engines or cycle models.
 *
 * Checks:
 *   0. HARNESS — capture a real attract entry, place the target cell, and confirm the
 *      oracle run of 0x2d4e is deterministic (oracle vs oracle → identical whole state).
 *   1. EQUAL — loc_2d4e == oracle over RAM outside the stack scratch, and the routine's
 *      own effects (stamped tile, reset state block, queued sound) hold their values.
 *   2. TEETH (wrong tile) — a twin that stamps a different completion tile is CAUGHT at
 *      the stamped video-RAM cell.
 *   3. TEETH (wrong state) — a twin that seeds the wrong done/target code is CAUGHT at the
 *      state byte.
 *
