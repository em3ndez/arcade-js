/**
 * Memory-equivalence gate for enqueueSoundCommand (ROM 0x4ca5) — the shared sound-ring
 * enqueue tail that ~20 sound-trigger stubs jump/fall into.
 *
 * The routine takes a sound-command index (delivered in a register by the calling stub),
 * marks it pending (high bit), stores it into the ring slot at SOUND_HEAD, and advances
 * SOUND_HEAD to the next of 8 slots (wrapping after the eighth). Its declared live-out is
 * MEMORY-ONLY: the filled ring slot and the advanced write pointer. The command-with-high-
 * bit and flags the oracle leaves in registers are dead scratch no caller reads, so the
 * gate compares RAM + pc + SP, NOT the value registers (the honest-signature contract).
 *
 * ONE WRINKLE — the oracle saves and restores two register pairs on the stack, and The
 * Pit's stack is real diffed work RAM (0x83ff downward). Those pushes leave four dead
 * bytes just below the entry stack pointer that the idiomatic JS (which never touches the
 * stack) does not reproduce. They are classic dead stack scratch — overwritten by the
 * caller's own next push before anything reads them — so the RAM diff excludes exactly
 * that [SP-4, SP) window and compares everything else byte-for-byte.
 *
 * Five checks:
 *   0. IDENTITY (harness) — run the unit gate with both arms = the oracle; EQUAL proves
 *      the capture/clone/replay harness reaches 0x4ca5 in a real attract run (the sound
 *      stubs dispatch it ~145 times over 3000 frames).
 *   1. EQUAL (real dispatches, full contract) — for every captured entry, oracle vs
 *      enqueueSoundCommand leave identical RAM (outside the stack scratch) + pc + SP, and
 *      the ring slot + advanced pointer hold exactly the expected values. Attract feeds
 *      write pointers across all of 0..7, so the ring wrap is covered on real states.
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted wrap, pointer==7) — force SOUND_HEAD to 7 on both sides and confirm
 *      both write slot 7 and wrap the pointer to 0, identical — pinning the wrap explicitly.
 *   3. TEETH (real) — a twin that forgets the pending high bit is CAUGHT at the ring slot.
 *   4. TEETH (crafted wrap) — a twin that advances the pointer WITHOUT wrapping is CAUGHT
 *      at SOUND_HEAD on the pointer==7 entry (8 instead of 0).
 *
 * Run: node --test games/thepit/idiomatic/test/equivalence-4ca5.test.js
