/**
 * Memory-equivalence gate for requestSound6 (ROM 0x4c67) — the sound-trigger stub
 * that requests command 6 by delegating to the shared sound-ring enqueue (loc_4ca5).
 *
 * The stub's distinctive job is a single number: it queues command index 6, which
 * the shared enqueue marks pending (high bit) and stores into the ring slot at
 * SOUND_HEAD before advancing that pointer (wrapping after the eighth slot). Its
 * declared live-out is MEMORY-ONLY — the filled ring slot and advanced pointer — so
 * the gate compares RAM + pc + SP, NOT the value registers (the honest-signature
 * contract). No caller reads the command byte or flags the oracle path leaves in
 * registers; the next thing every caller does is reload before it reads.
 *
 * SAME STACK WRINKLE as the enqueue tail: the oracle path saves and restores two
 * register pairs on the stack, and The Pit's stack is real diffed work RAM (0x83ff
 * downward). Those pushes leave four dead bytes just below the entry stack pointer
 * that the stack-free idiomatic JS never reproduces — classic dead stack scratch,
 * overwritten by the caller's own next push before anything reads them — so the RAM
 * diff excludes exactly that [SP-4, SP) window and compares everything else.
 *
 * A timing wrinkle: unlike its boot-time siblings, command 6 is requested only once
 * the attract demo is well underway (a few hundred frames in), so the capture run
 * needs a larger frame budget to reach it — hence maxFrames well above the default.
 *
 * Four checks:
 *   0. IDENTITY (harness) — run the unit gate with both arms = the oracle; EQUAL
 *      proves the capture/clone/replay harness reaches 0x4c67 in a real attract run.
 *   1. EQUAL (real dispatch, full contract) — for the captured entry, oracle vs
 *      requestSound6 leave identical RAM (outside the stack scratch) + pc + SP, and
 *      the ring slot holds 0x86 (6 | pending bit) with the pointer advanced.
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted wrap, pointer==7) — force SOUND_HEAD to 7 on both sides and
 *      confirm both write slot 7 with command 6 and wrap the pointer to 0, identical.
 *   3. TEETH — a twin that requests the WRONG command index (7, the neighbour stub's
 *      payload) MUST be caught at the ring slot (0x87 instead of 0x86).
 *
 * Run: node --test games/thepit/idiomatic/test/equivalence-4c67.test.js
