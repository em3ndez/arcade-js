/**
 * Memory-equivalence gate for loc_1468 (ROM 0x1468) — settle the object's animation phase toward a
 * move command, deferring the frame while it settles, then dispatch the object's move handler.
 *
 * One arm of the at-rest object dispatcher (loc_144c), reached when the per-frame move command
 * carries a direction bit (bit 2 or bit 3). It runs the command through the animation-phase byte
 * 0x801a — a short wind-up counter packed in the byte's high bits with the command in the low bits:
 * a settled phase dispatches the move handler, a clear phase arms the wind-up then dispatches, and a
 * mid-wind-up phase steps the counter down and DEFERS the frame (snapping straight to the command
 * once it has run far enough). The dispatch splits on the command's bit 2: set -> the frame-stamp
 * handler loc_186a, clear -> the step-and-resolve handler loc_1a02.
 *
 * The declared LIVE-OUT is MEMORY-ONLY: the phase byte plus whatever the dispatched handler (or the
 * deferral record) writes. The move command is its one genuine register live-in, surfaced as the
 * moveCommand parameter (defaulting to the register, so a no-arg call reproduces the oracle); it is
 * read, never written, so it stays intact for the handlers. Registers/flags/pc/SP are excluded per
 * the honest-signature contract — the idiomatic layer does not preserve the Z80 register/step trace.
 *
 * THE STACK SCRATCH. The comparison runs the still-frozen ORACLE loc_1468 (every terminal a tail
 * `m.call` to the frozen handler/deferral routines) against the stack-free idiomatic routine (which
 * calls its already-idiomatic callees directly). loc_1468 does no stack manipulation of its own, so
 * for the arms this gate exercises the two leave byte-identical RAM including the stack; the diff
 * still excludes the standard dead-scratch window just below the entry stack pointer (The Pit's
 * stack is real diffed work RAM, ~0x83fd here) as the defensive guard for the delegated award /
 * deferral push chain — every real output sits far below the stack (0x801a plus the handlers'
 * 0x8020..0x80e7 and video RAM), so the window can hide none; the teeth confirm it.
 *
 * Checks:
 *   0. HARNESS   — capture real 0x1468 dispatches from attract; confirm the oracle run is
 *      deterministic and that all three arms (settled dispatch, wind-down, arm) occur in a real run.
 *   1. EQUAL     — loc_1468 == oracle over RAM across every real attract dispatch (the demo's
 *      command is always bit 2, so these settle onto / dispatch through loc_186a).
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted bit-3 dispatch) — force a settled bit-3 command: both dispatch the OTHER
 *      handler (loc_1a02), identical; and it produces a different result than the bit-2 command on
 *      the same base, proving the bit-2 dispatch really selects the handler.
 *   3. EQUAL (crafted snap wind-down) — force a mid-wind-up phase that has run far enough to snap
 *      straight to the command: both write the snapped phase and defer, identical.
 *   4. NON-VACUOUS — the arm arm actually seeds the phase byte high and the wind-down actually
 *      steps it, matching the oracle (a no-op twin cannot pass).
 *   5. TEETH (phase) — a twin that leaves the wrong settled phase on a wind-down entry is CAUGHT at
 *      the phase byte.
 *   6. TEETH (dispatch) — a twin that defers instead of dispatching on a settled entry is CAUGHT by
 *      the handler's missing writes.
 *
