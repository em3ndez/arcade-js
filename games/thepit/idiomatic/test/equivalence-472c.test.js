/**
 * Memory-equivalence gate for redrawScoreHud (ROM 0x472c, The Pit) — the score-HUD
 * refresh. It sweeps both player slots (copy the player's saved state into the shared
 * display slot, repaint its four score digits, blank the two cells above the score
 * column), restores the active player, draws the status label from the player count
 * (one/two players -> the in-game panel loc_47e1, otherwise -> the "GAME OVER" label
 * loc_48e5), and tints colour 2 up two HUD colour columns.
 *
 * THE CONTRACT — OBSERVABLE RAM. This gate used to assert whole RAM + pc + SP, because
 * the two status-label routines it calls (loc_47e1 @ 0x47e1, drawGameOverLabel @ 0x48e5)
 * tail-JUMPED into the colour-column filler 0x3e01 via an m.call whose `ret` popped the
 * label return slot redrawScoreHud had pushed (0x4768 / 0x476d) — so the whole Z80 stack
 * reconverged and pc + SP still matched the oracle. That tail-jump has now been DISSOLVED
 * on both routines into a DIRECT JS call `return fillColourColumn(m)`. A direct JS call
 * has no Z80 stack frame: fillColourColumn paints its column but never rets, so the label
 * return slot redrawScoreHud pushed is left on the stack and the routine's own closing
 * m.ret() pops THAT slot instead of the caller's return. pc and SP therefore diverge from
 * the oracle by exactly one un-popped return slot (SP off by 2), and the dead residual
 * value registers diverge too. All three are EXCLUDED here — they are dead ABI (see the
 * justification below) and the Z80-return modelling the idiomatic layer deliberately drops.
 *
 * WHY THAT DIVERGENCE IS BENIGN (not masking a bug):
 *   1. RAM is byte-for-byte identical (ram=null on every arm below). A Z80 `ret` only
 *      reads the stack and adjusts SP; it writes no memory, so the un-popped slot changes
 *      no RAM — the oracle and the idiomatic push the SAME bytes to the SAME stack address,
 *      the oracle merely pops one more of them. The full RAM dump (stack included) matches.
 *   2. The diverged value registers are dead. All three callers of 0x472c reload their
 *      registers with a constant as the very first instruction after the call — loc_0673
 *      (06a3: `ld a,0x01`), loc_3a6f (3a78: `ld a,0x01`; 3a7a: `ld c,0x02`), loc_3cc1
 *      (3cc7: `ld a,0x07`) — so nothing reads the register file redrawScoreHud leaves.
 *   3. The diverged pc / SP have no live consumer. redrawScoreHud is not wired live (no
 *      manifest override, no idiomatic importer): the three callers dispatch to the frozen
 *      oracle loc_472c, whose stack unwinds correctly. When the HUD chain is later wired
 *      fully idiomatic, callers reach it as a direct JS call and regain control by the JS
 *      return, not the Z80 stack — the closing m.ret() is then vestigial ABI modelling.
 *   (See equivalence-3968.test.js / equivalence-47e1.test.js for the sibling dissolves.)
 *
 * The routine's only observable output is RAM: both players' repainted score digits, the
 * blanked cells above each score column, the status label glyphs + colour, and the two
 * tinted HUD colour columns — compared byte-for-byte, with ONE wrinkle:
 *
 *   THE STACK SCRATCH. The Pit's stack is real diffed work RAM (entry SP 0x83fb here). The
 *   dissolved handoff removed the push16 return slots redrawScoreHud parked just below the
 *   entry SP (the ghost byte at 0x83f7 = SP-4: oracle wrote it, the stack-free idiomatic never
 *   does), and neither side writes ABOVE the entry SP. Classic dead stack scratch, overwritten
 *   by the caller's next push before anything reads it — so the diff excludes exactly the
 *   [SP-8, SP) window and compares everything else byte-for-byte. Every real output (score
 *   digits, blanks, label, the tinted colour columns at 0x89xx/0x8bxx) sits far below the
 *   stack, so the window never hides one — the teeth confirm it (caught at real painted cells,
 *   never at the excluded 0x83f7).
 *
 * Checks:
 *   1. EQUAL (captured) — the real attract dispatch is the game-over arm (player count 0,
 *      "GAME OVER" label); idiomatic == oracle on the whole RAM dump.
 *   2. EQUAL (harness) — an independent fresh capture of the real dispatch, clone/replay,
 *      RAM-EQUAL outside the [SP-8, SP) stack scratch (NOT through unitEquivalence: its
 *      full-dump diff would false-catch the removed push16 ghost at 0x83f7 first).
 *   3. EQUAL (crafted) — a player-count-1 entry forces the in-game-panel arm (loc_47e1),
 *      which attract never reaches; idiomatic == oracle on RAM there too.
 *   4. IDENTITY — oracle vs oracle is fully EQUAL (gate wiring sanity; identical arms
 *      share pc + registers, so the strict harness still reports equal here).
 *   5. MODEL — a structural re-emit of the routine (driving the oracle label routines
 *      through the registry, so the correct instance is itself RAM-EQUAL to the oracle),
 *      so each teeth twin below differs from the oracle by exactly one thing.
 *   6. TEETH — a wrong HUD colour and a wrong blank offset are both CAUGHT on the RAM
 *      dump, and a corrupted output through the harness is CAUGHT at the corrupted painted
 *      cell — never masked by the excluded stack scratch.
