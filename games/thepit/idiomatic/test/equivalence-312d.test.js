/**
 * Memory-equivalence gate for advanceObjectMovers (ROM 0x312d) — the per-frame object-
 * pair mover pass: drive object 1 through the shared move/collision driver, stage its
 * sprite record, then hand off object 2.
 *
 * CONTRACT. The routine's declared live-out is MEMORY-ONLY — object 1's committed record,
 * its four staged sprite bytes, and whatever the mover / delegated tails leave. It is
 * reached by tail-jump (the per-frame backdrop driver loc_2f71 jumps here), so no caller
 * reads a value register back; the gate compares work RAM (dumpState) and excludes the
 * Z80 pc/SP/value-registers the honest-signature rewrite does not preserve.
 *
 * TWO INPUT SOURCES.
 *   - REAL captured attract dispatches. loc_2f71 tail-jumps here every frame, so the pass
 *     runs continuously in the demo — exercising the real object records + the branch the
 *     demo takes for free.
 *   - CRAFTED entries. A real attract state is poked (identically on both sides) on the
 *     intro/phase counter to force each branch: skip-both (counter < 8), object-1-only
 *     (game mode 4, counter 8..9), and object-1 + object-2 (counter >= 10).
 *
 * ONE WRINKLE — object 1's mover (stepEnemyMover) can, on its rare arrival/capture tail, reach
 * the round/state-boundary transition, whose real successor chain converges at two TRUE
 * oracle leaves (0x031a round setup, 0x01f9 reset entry) that never return on hardware
 * (they busy-wait on the vblank NMI, which never fires on a single-routine clone). Both
 * arms reach those same leaves, so the gate stubs them identically on both clones and
 * models the once-per-frame tick their frame-waits drain, so the transition terminates.
 * The RAM diff excludes the dead top-of-stack scratch the oracle's driver calls (and any
 * SP reset) leave and the stack-free candidate does not — the mover records (0x8068..
 * 0x8123) and the sprite staging buffer (0x8220..0x823f) live far below both windows.
 *
 * Checks:
 *   0. HARNESS — capture real 0x312d attract dispatches; the oracle run is deterministic.
 *   1. EQUAL (real dispatches) — advanceObjectMovers == oracle over RAM on every capture.
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted skip-both) — counter < 8 runs neither mover, identical to the oracle.
 *   3. EQUAL (crafted object-1-only) — game mode 4 + counter 9 runs only object 1 + stages
 *      its sprite (bias applied), identical to the oracle.
 *   4. EQUAL (crafted object-1 + object-2) — counter >= 10 runs both, identical to the oracle.
 *   5. TEETH (dropped bias) — a twin that stages object 1's 4th sprite byte WITHOUT the
 *      sprite-coordinate bias is CAUGHT at that byte.
 *   6. TEETH (corrupt verbatim byte) — a twin that corrupts a verbatim sprite-record byte
 *      is CAUGHT at that byte.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/thepit/idiomatic/test/equivalence-312d.test.js
