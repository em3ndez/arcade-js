/**
 * Memory-equivalence gate for loc_1704 (ROM 0x1704) — resolve a moving actor's horizontal step
 * against the terrain it is entering: collect a loot tile, hold against a wall, bump-react on a
 * blocked diagonal, or walk on.
 *
 * Given the actor's tile-cell pointer (register live-in, surfaced as tilePtr) and its move
 * direction (moveDir), it writes the whole outcome of the step to work RAM and then hands off to
 * either walkActor (walk on) or stageObjectSpriteRecord (hold / rebuild in place) — both already
 * idiomatic, so loc_1704 calls them directly; no register hand-off survives. Its declared
 * LIVE-OUT is MEMORY-ONLY: the pickup counters (0x8081/0x8082), the score/digits/sound on a
 * collect, the blanked cell, the bump-reaction state/timer/sprite (0x80a2/0x80a4/0x8069), the
 * walk position/frame, and the display record.
 *
 * THE STACK SCRATCH. The comparison runs the still-frozen ORACLE loc_1704, whose tail-jumps and
 * loot-award calls thread through the stack (push16 / m.call / the sound + score sub-calls save
 * register pairs), against the stack-free idiomatic handler chain. The two therefore leave
 * different dead bytes just below the entry stack pointer (The Pit's stack is real diffed work
 * RAM, entry SP 0x83fd here) — classic dead scratch, overwritten by the caller's next push before
 * anything reads it. The diff excludes exactly that [SP-N, SP) window and compares everything else
 * byte-for-byte; every real output sits far below (0x8020..0x80bd plus video RAM), so the window
 * can never hide one — the teeth confirm it. Registers/flags/pc/SP are excluded (the honest-
 * signature contract); the two register live-ins default to the registers so a no-arg call
 * reproduces the oracle exactly.
 *
 * Checks:
 *   0. IDENTITY (harness) — oracle vs oracle on a captured attract entry; proves the
 *      capture/clone/replay harness reaches 0x1704 in a real run.
 *   1. EQUAL (real dispatches) — every captured attract dispatch leaves identical state outside
 *      the stack scratch. Attract exercises the wall-block, bump-react and walk-on paths.
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted loot collect) — force the collect paths attract never aligns onto: tile 58
 *      (+10) and tiles 59..61 (+20) across latch-open / first-open-guard-clear / guard-set.
 *   3. EQUAL (crafted bump-react) — a real grid-step entry poked to a walkable-band tile whose
 *      direction table mismatches, arming the bump reaction; both arms agree.
 *   4. NON-VACUOUS — a tile-58 collect actually bumps the counter, blanks the cell, queues the
 *      sound and advances the walk (a no-op twin cannot pass), and agrees with the oracle.
 *   5. TEETH (loot count) — a twin that fails to bump the pickup counter is CAUGHT at 0x8081.
 *   6. TEETH (bump reaction) — on an arming entry, a twin that skips the reaction sprite is CAUGHT
 *      at SPRITE_CODE.
 *   7. TEETH (walk) — on a walk entry, a twin that corrupts the walk position is CAUGHT at OBJ_X.
