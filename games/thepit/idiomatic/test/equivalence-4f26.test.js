/**
 * Memory-equivalence gate for loc_4f26 (ROM 0x4f26) — steps a caller's bounded cyclic
 * index down one notch and requests sound 8.
 *
 * The routine has two observable effects: a MEMORY effect (the sound request fills a ring
 * slot and advances the write pointer, via the shared enqueue) and a REGISTER LIVE-OUT
 * (the stepped index the caller reads back). The honest signature surfaces the live-in
 * index as a parameter and the new index as the RETURN, so the gate compares RAM + pc + SP
 * AND asserts the returned index against the value the oracle leaves in the index register.
 * The oracle's other exit registers and flags are dead and excluded.
 *
 * WHY A CRAFTED ENTRY. 0x4f26 is never dispatched in a boot/attract run (a probe over 3000
 * frames sees 0), so the capture/replay harness cannot hook it directly. Per the
 * crafted-entry method the gate runs it from a REAL captured sound-request state: the
 * sibling stub 0x4c57 (command 2) IS reached during attract, and its entry is a faithful
 * machine — a valid stack with a return address and an in-play ring pointer. Crucially
 * 0x4f26 never calls 0x4c57, so cloning that entry introduces no registry recursion (0x4f26
 * requests its sound through 0x4c6f, a different stub). The two inputs that shape the output
 * — the index and the ring write pointer — are then swept identically on both sides: the
 * index EXHAUSTIVELY over all 256 values, the pointer over all 8 slots (pinning the 7 -> 0
 * wrap).
 *
 * ONE WRINKLE — the oracle path (0x4f26 calls 0x4c6f -> shared enqueue 0x4ca5) parks dead
 * bytes on the stack that the stack-free idiomatic JS does not reproduce: the enqueue saves
 * and restores two register pairs (4 bytes) and 0x4f26's own call pushes a 2-byte return
 * address, so six dead bytes sit just below the entry stack pointer. The Pit's stack is real
 * diffed work RAM, so the RAM diff excludes exactly that [SP-6, SP) window (classic dead
 * stack scratch, overwritten before anything reads it) and compares everything else
 * byte-for-byte. The idiomatic routine models its return as a plain JS return, so the
 * contract check does one m.ret() on the candidate after the call to line pc + SP up with
 * the oracle (which rets internally).
 *
 * Checks:
 *   0. HARNESS — capture a real 0x4c57 sound-request entry and confirm the oracle run of
 *      0x4f26 is deterministic (oracle vs oracle -> identical whole state).
 *   1. EQUAL (real entry) — loc_4f26 == oracle over RAM (outside the stack scratch) + pc +
 *      SP, and the returned index matches the oracle's stepped index.
 *   2. EQUAL (exhaustive index sweep 0..255 x ring pointer 0..7) — for every index and every
 *      write pointer, the returned index and the filled/advanced ring match the oracle. This
 *      pins the in-range step, the off-sentinel re-entry at the top, the floor -> off drop,
 *      and the 7 -> 0 ring wrap.
 *   3. TEETH (wrong sound) — a twin that requests sound 7 instead of 8 is CAUGHT by the RAM
 *      diff at the ring slot.
 *   4. TEETH (wrong step) — a twin that steps the index UP instead of down is CAUGHT by the
 *      returned-index assertion (a bug the RAM diff alone would miss, since the index is a
 *      register live-out, not RAM).
