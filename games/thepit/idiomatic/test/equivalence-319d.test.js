/**
 * Memory-equivalence gate for stepEnemyMover (ROM 0x319d) — the per-frame enemy/object move
 * step: arrival, player-box capture, object-box retarget, and steer into a movement
 * preset.
 *
 * CONTRACT. The routine's declared live-out is MEMORY-ONLY — the mover's state/timer/
 * position bytes, the probe-cell pointer + sub-tile phase, the retarget/capture writes,
 * and whatever the tail preset or transition leaves. The mover is reached by tail-jump,
 * so no caller reads a value register back; the gate compares work RAM (dumpState) and
 * excludes the Z80 pc/SP/value-registers the honest-signature rewrite does not preserve.
 *
 * TWO INPUT SOURCES.
 *   - REAL captured attract dispatches. 0x319d runs thousands of times in the demo, so
 *     the entry state machine and the top-row / far-edge cells are exercised for free;
 *     the demo never takes a probe steer arm, so those are crafted below.
 *   - CRAFTED entries. A real attract state is poked (identically on both sides) to force
 *     the player-box capture, the object-box retarget, and every column/direction steer
 *     arm — the paths attract does not reach.
 *
 * ONE WRINKLE — the arrival / capture tails hand off to the round/state-boundary
 * transition (tickObjectDwellThenTransition -> dockManAndDispatchRoundBoundary), whose real successor chain converges at two TRUE
 * oracle leaves (0x031a round setup, 0x01f9 reset entry) that never return on hardware
 * (they busy-wait on the vblank NMI, which never fires on a single-routine clone). Both
 * the oracle and the candidate reach those same leaves, so the gate stubs them
 * identically on both clones and models the once-per-frame tick their frame-waits drain,
 * so the transition terminates. The RAM diff excludes the dead top-of-stack scratch the
 * oracle's calls (and the chain's SP reset) leave and the stack-free candidate does not.
 *
 * Checks:
 *   0. HARNESS — capture real 0x319d attract dispatches; the oracle run is deterministic.
 *   1. EQUAL (real dispatches) — stepEnemyMover == oracle over RAM on every captured entry.
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted capture/retarget) — the player-box capture and object-box retarget
 *      paths match the oracle, with positive checks on the armed pose + park state.
 *   3. EQUAL (crafted steer grid) — over a grid of position / column / direction the
 *      chosen probe arm + preset match the oracle byte-for-byte.
 *   4. TEETH (wrong capture pose) — a retarget twin that arms sprite 52 instead of 53 is
 *      CAUGHT at the sprite code.
 *   5. TEETH (wrong probe-cell pointer) — a steer twin that corrupts the decoded cell
 *      pointer is CAUGHT at PROBE_CELL_PTR.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/thepit/idiomatic/test/equivalence-319d.test.js
