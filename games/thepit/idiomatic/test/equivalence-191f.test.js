/**
 * Memory-equivalence gate for triggerDigReaction (ROM 0x191f) — the dig-arm of the actor-movement
 * classifier: it sorts the tile code under a digging actor into an escape band, an always-hit
 * code list, the sub-cell bit-2 gate, the diggable ROM-table lookup, or a keep-moving path,
 * and stages a reaction (scratch bytes 0x80a2-0x80a7, PLAYER_FACING, NEXT_TILE) plus, for an
 * armed actor, an arm-state bump and a sound request, before handing off to the record
 * builder (stageObjectSpriteRecord) or the movement continuation (0x19d0).
 *
 * Its declared LIVE-OUT is MEMORY-ONLY: everything it produces lands in work RAM (the staged
 * reaction, the per-actor arm state, the sound ring, and stageObjectSpriteRecord's record). The oracle's
 * residual registers are dead ABI — and because the idiomatic tail calls the decompiled
 * stageObjectSpriteRecord / enqueueSoundCommand directly (no Z80 ret, no stack pushes) rather than the
 * oracle's stack-threaded tail, comparing the full register file or SP would false-fail an
 * honest rewrite. So the gate is the state dump only (via firstStateDiff), matching stageObjectSpriteRecord's
 * contract — with ONE wrinkle:
 *
 *   THE STACK SCRATCH. The Pit's stack is real diffed work RAM (entry SP = 0x83fd here). On
 *   the armed sound path the oracle pushes a return address and the enqueue tail saves two
 *   register pairs — six dead bytes parked in [SP-6, SP) that the stack-free idiomatic never
 *   writes (confirmed: on the sound path those six bytes are the ONLY difference, and every
 *   named RAM byte matches). Classic dead stack scratch — overwritten by the caller's next
 *   push before anything reads it — so the diff excludes exactly the [SP-8, SP) window and
 *   compares everything else byte-for-byte.
 *
 * SIX checks:
 *   0. IDENTITY (harness) — run oracle vs oracle on a captured entry; EQUAL proves the
 *      capture/clone/replay harness reaches 0x191f in a real attract run (263 dispatches).
 *   1. EQUAL (real dispatches) — for every captured entry, oracle vs idiomatic leave identical
 *      state outside the stack scratch. Attract feeds tile codes 0x26/0x41/0x70/0x78 and all
 *      eight sub-cell offsets, so the escape/keep-moving/diggable-lookup arms are covered live.
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted branch sweep) — force every branch identically on both arms: the escape
 *      band, each always-hit code, the bit-2 gate (set/clear), 196 vs [150,154), the diggable
 *      lookup (mismatch with/without sound, boundary skip, neighbour in/out of range), and the
 *      >=154 / <113 keep-moving arms.
 *   3. NON-VACUOUS — pre-set the staged-reaction bytes to a sentinel on a mismatch entry; both
 *      arms must overwrite every one and agree, so a no-op twin cannot pass.
 *   4. TEETH (reaction) — a twin that writes the wrong reaction step (0 instead of 3) is
 *      CAUGHT at 0x80a2.
 *   5. TEETH (sound) — a twin that requests the wrong sound command is CAUGHT at the ring slot.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/thepit/idiomatic/test/equivalence-191f.test.js
