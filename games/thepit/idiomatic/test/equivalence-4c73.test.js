/**
 * Memory-equivalence gate for requestSound9 (ROM 0x4c73) — the sound-trigger stub that
 * requests sound-command 9 by handing it to the shared sound-ring enqueue.
 *
 * The stub's whole effect is memory: the command (high bit set to mark it pending) lands
 * in the ring slot at SOUND_HEAD and the write pointer advances to the next of 8 slots,
 * wrapping after the eighth. Its declared live-out is MEMORY-ONLY — the filled slot and
 * the advanced pointer — so the gate compares RAM + pc + SP, not the value registers the
 * oracle leaves behind (the honest-signature contract).
 *
 * WHY A CRAFTED ENTRY. Attract requests other sound commands (2 among them) but never
 * command 9, so 0x4c73 is never dispatched — the capture/replay harness cannot hook it
 * directly. Per the crafted-entry method the gate instead runs the stub from a REAL
 * captured sound-request state: the sibling stub 0x4c57 (command 2) IS reached during
 * attract, and every sibling shares the same call convention, so its entry state is a
 * faithful state for command 9 too. Crucially 0x4c73 never calls 0x4c57, so cloning that
 * entry introduces no registry recursion. The one input that shapes the output — the ring
 * write pointer — is then swept across all of 0..7 by poking SOUND_HEAD identically on
 * both sides, which also pins the 7 -> 0 wrap.
 *
 * ONE WRINKLE — the oracle path (0x4c73 -> shared enqueue 0x4ca5) saves and restores two
 * register pairs on the stack, and The Pit's stack is real diffed work RAM (0x83ff down).
 * Those pushes leave four dead bytes just below the entry stack pointer that the stack-free
 * idiomatic JS does not reproduce; they are classic dead stack scratch (overwritten by the
 * caller's next push before anything reads them), so the RAM diff excludes exactly that
 * [SP-4, SP) window and compares everything else byte-for-byte. The idiomatic routine
 * models its return as a plain JS return, so the contract check does one m.ret() on the
 * candidate after the call to line pc + SP up with the oracle (which rets internally).
 *
 * Five checks:
 *   0. HARNESS — capture a real 0x4c57 sound-request entry and confirm the oracle run of
 *      0x4c73 is deterministic (oracle vs oracle -> identical whole state). Proves the
 *      capture/clone/diff plumbing reaches a real sound-request state.
 *   1. EQUAL (real sound-request entry) — requestSound9 == oracle over RAM (outside the
 *      stack scratch) + pc + SP, and the ring slot + advanced pointer hold the expected
 *      values.
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted pointer sweep 0..7) — with SOUND_HEAD forced to each of 0..7, both
 *      write that slot with the pending command and advance/wrap the pointer, identical.
 *   3. TEETH (wrong command) — a twin that requests command 8 (a sibling's index) instead
 *      of 9 is CAUGHT at the ring slot (this stub's payload is the index, exactly what the
 *      mutation attacks).
 *   4. TEETH (missing pending bit) — a twin that queues 9 without the pending high bit is
 *      CAUGHT at the ring slot (an unmarked slot reads as empty to the driver).
 *
 * Run: node --test games/thepit/idiomatic/test/equivalence-4c73.test.js
