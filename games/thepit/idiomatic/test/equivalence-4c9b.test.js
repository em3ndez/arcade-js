/**
 * Memory-equivalence gate for requestSound19 (ROM 0x4c9b) — the sound-trigger stub that
 * requests sound-command 19 by handing it to the shared sound-ring enqueue.
 *
 * The stub's whole effect is memory: the command (high bit set to mark it pending) lands
 * in the ring slot at SOUND_HEAD and the write pointer advances to the next of 8 slots,
 * wrapping after the eighth. Its declared live-out is MEMORY-ONLY — the filled slot and
 * the advanced pointer. The idiomatic path delegates to the shared enqueue with a plain
 * JS call and does NOT run the Z80 ret, so the gate compares the OBSERVABLE RAM effect
 * only — not pc, not SP, not the dead value registers the oracle leaves behind (the
 * honest-signature contract).
 *
 * WHY A CRAFTED ENTRY. Attract requests other sound commands but never command 19, so
 * 0x4c9b is never dispatched — the capture/replay harness cannot hook it directly. Per
 * the crafted-entry method the gate instead runs the stub from a REAL captured sound-
 * request state: the sibling stub 0x4c57 (command 2) IS reached during attract, and every
 * sibling shares the same call convention, so its entry state is a faithful state for
 * command 19 too. Crucially 0x4c9b never calls 0x4c57, so cloning that entry introduces no
 * registry recursion. The one input that shapes the output — the ring write pointer — is
 * then swept across all of 0..7 by poking SOUND_HEAD identically on both sides, which also
 * pins the 7 -> 0 wrap.
 *
 * ONE WRINKLE — the oracle path (0x4c9b -> shared enqueue 0x4ca5) saves and restores two
 * register pairs on the stack, and The Pit's stack is real diffed work RAM (0x83ff down).
 * Those pushes leave four dead bytes just below the entry stack pointer that the stack-free
 * idiomatic JS does not reproduce; they are classic dead stack scratch (overwritten by the
 * caller's next push before anything reads them), so the RAM diff excludes exactly that
 * [SP-4, SP) window and compares everything else byte-for-byte.
 *
 * Five checks:
 *   0. HARNESS — capture a real 0x4c57 sound-request entry and confirm the oracle run of
 *      0x4c9b is deterministic (oracle vs oracle -> identical whole state). Proves the
 *      capture/clone/diff plumbing reaches a real sound-request state.
 *   1. EQUAL (real sound-request entry) — requestSound19 == oracle over RAM (outside the
 *      stack scratch), and the ring slot + advanced pointer hold the expected values.
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted pointer sweep 0..7) — with SOUND_HEAD forced to each of 0..7, both
 *      write that slot with the pending command and advance/wrap the pointer, identical.
 *   3. TEETH (wrong command) — a twin that requests command 20 instead of 19 is CAUGHT at
 *      the ring slot (this stub's payload is the index, exactly what the mutation attacks).
 *   4. TEETH (missing pending bit) — a twin that queues 19 without the pending high bit is
 *      CAUGHT at the ring slot (an unmarked slot reads as empty to the driver).
 *
 * Run: node --test games/thepit/idiomatic/test/equivalence-4c9b.test.js
