/**
 * Memory-equivalence gate for loc_186f (ROM 0x186f) — locate the tracked object's tile cell,
 * read the tile under it, and hand the object to the matching per-frame handler.
 *
 * From the object's position counters (plus the caller's horizontal bias) it derives the row
 * and column cell coordinates, the video-RAM cell address, and the tile sitting there, publishes
 * them, then routes: the goal tile past the crossing position -> the walk-forward continuation
 * (advanceActorWalk); everything else -> the loot/dig collector (collectLootTile). Its declared
 * LIVE-OUT is MEMORY-ONLY (the cell coordinates + address, the published under-tile and cleared
 * next-tile slot, the goal latches, and whatever the handoff handler writes). Both handlers are
 * already idiomatic, so loc_186f calls them directly — no register hand-off survives.
 *
 * THE STACK SCRATCH. The comparison runs the still-frozen ORACLE loc_186f, whose tail-jumps
 * thread through the stack (m.call/push16), against the stack-free idiomatic handler chain. The
 * two therefore leave different dead bytes just below the entry stack pointer (The Pit's stack
 * is real diffed work RAM, ~0x83fd here) — classic dead scratch, overwritten by the caller's
 * next push before anything reads it. The diff excludes exactly that [SP-N, SP) window and
 * compares everything else byte-for-byte; the real outputs all sit far below the stack
 * (0x8020..0x80e7 plus video RAM), so the window can never hide one — the teeth confirm it.
 *
 * Registers/flags/pc/SP are excluded (the honest-signature contract): the idiomatic layer does
 * not preserve the Z80 register/step trace, and the horizontal bias — loc_186f's one genuine
 * register live-in — is surfaced as the columnBias parameter (defaulting to the register, so a
 * no-arg call reproduces the oracle exactly).
 *
 * Checks:
 *   0. IDENTITY (harness) — oracle vs oracle on a captured attract entry; proves the
 *      capture/clone/replay harness reaches 0x186f in a real run.
 *   1. EQUAL (real dispatches) — every captured attract dispatch leaves identical state outside
 *      the stack scratch. Attract takes the ordinary-tile path into the collector.
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted goal tile, past crossing) — force the under-tile to the goal tile with the
 *      position past the crossing point: both latch the goal + crossing and route to the
 *      walk-forward continuation, identical.
 *   3. EQUAL (crafted goal tile, before crossing) — goal tile but short of the crossing point:
 *      both latch the goal and still route to the collector, identical.
 *   4. NON-VACUOUS — a real dispatch actually writes the row/column cells, the cell address, and
 *      publishes the under-tile (a no-op twin cannot pass), and agrees with the oracle.
 *   5. TEETH (row) — a twin with a wrong row cell is CAUGHT at OBJ_TILE_ROW.
 *   6. TEETH (tile) — a twin that publishes the wrong under-tile is CAUGHT at CUR_TILE.
 *   7. TEETH (goal latch) — on a goal entry, a twin that skips the goal latch is CAUGHT at
 *      GOAL_TILE_LATCH.
 *
