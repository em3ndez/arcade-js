 * Memory-equivalence gate for steerDemoPlayer (ROM 0x03e8, The Pit) — the attract
 * demo's wall-follower that writes the one-of-four steering direction
 * (DEMO_STEER_DIR, 0x801b) the movement dispatcher reads in place of the joystick.
 *
 * CONTRACT — OBSERVABLE RAM (relaxed after the callee dissolve). This gate USED to demand
 * whole-RAM + exit pc + SP byte-identity. That broke when the two painters this routine
 * reaches — drawCreditsDisplay (panel repaint) and loc_48c4 (column recolour) — were dissolved: their
 * inner layout/colour helpers (rowColToTileOffset, deriveTileWriteCursors, fillColourColumn)
 * are now DIRECT JS calls with no Z80 stack frame. steerDemoPlayer itself is UNCHANGED
 * — its two housekeeping arms still `push16` a Z80 return address and then call the painter —
 * but those push16 brackets are now unbalanced (no callee `ret` unwinds them), and the direct
 * JS helpers push no nested return addresses. Two by-construction divergences result, both
 * proven dead, both excluded here:
 *
 *   - A dead STACK-SCRATCH window [entrySP-4, entrySP). Measured across every real captured
 *     dispatch AND every crafted arm (busy-tick, painter-only, tick-recolour, both-brackets,
 *     the full classify sweep), the RAM divergence is confined to exactly these four bytes
 *     (0x83f9..0x83fc for the captured entrySP 0x83fd): return-address bytes the oracle's
 *     nested CALLs park below SP that the stack-free direct JS helpers never write. This is
 *     the same [SP-4, SP) dead scratch the sibling dissolve equivalence-4c5f.test.js excludes.
 *   - The exit pc + SP. They match the oracle EXACTLY on the classify path (no bracket arm),
 *     and diverge only in the two bracket arms, where the routine's own final `ret` pops a
 *     bracket instead of the real return address. They are DEAD: the ONLY caller of 0x03e8 is
 *     the main loop loc_0348, which re-seats `ld sp,0x83ff` (regs.sp = 0x83ff) at the top of
 *     EVERY pass and never reads the leftover pc/registers as data — the leftover SP/pc is
 *     discarded before anything consumes it. (0x03e8 is not even wired live yet — the manifest
 *     still dispatches it to the oracle.) So pc + SP are EXCLUDED, NOT re-aligned with a
 *     modelled ret: unlike the tail-call siblings (4894/4c5f), steerDemoPlayer does its
 *     OWN final ret, so there is no tail return to model and the bracket-arm pc/SP cannot be
 *     lined up anyway. RAM-only, like equivalence-3968.test.js, plus the [SP-4,SP) exclusion.
 *
 * Net: the honest live-out is MEMORY-ONLY (the steer direction, band hint, timer, and the panel/colour
 * cells the painters write) and the gate compares the observable RAM dump byte-for-byte
 * outside the dead stack window. Verified: ZERO observable (at/above entrySP) divergences
 * across all 40 real captured dispatches plus every crafted arm. The teeth twins all bite
 * observable cells (DEMO_STEER_DIR 0x801b / BAND_HINT 0x800c / FILL_LEN 0x8055 — far below the
 * stack window) and are still caught.
 *
 * WHAT THIS ROUTINE NEEDS FROM THE GATE, and how it is met:
 *
 *   1. REAL dispatches for the housekeeping arms. The main loop runs 0x03e8 only
 *      while the game-mode byte is 4 — which the attract demo does enter — so real
 *      captured entries are available. The very first one (frame 1 of the demo)
 *      is rich: it repaints the panel (drawCreditsDisplay), reloads the 30-frame timer, and
 *      recolours a column (loc_48c4) before the probe-absent early return. Later
 *      entries exercise the timer countdown + early return. EQUAL is proven on all.
 *
 *   2. CRAFTED entries for the classification chain. Attract's demo never presents a
 *      live probe object (0x8079 stays 0), so the whole band-scan is unreached in the
 *      wild. A real entry is nudged into the classify path (skip the painter, hold the
 *      timer off its 30-frame tick, mark the probe live) and then swept: the probe
 *      X/Y across every wall-line value and the band hint across every band, so every
 *      band, wall line, and half-plane split is driven on both sides.
 *
 *   3. Its callees (drawCreditsDisplay, loc_48c4) are already idiomatic and are imported and
 *      called directly by the routine, and the oracle reaches the same two routines
 *      through the registry — so both sides run identical callee code and the gate
 *      tests 0x03e8's own logic and routing (the dissolve consequence above is theirs,
 *      not this routine's, and is excluded as the dead scratch it is).
 *
 * Run: node --test games/thepit/idiomatic/test/equivalence-03e8.test.js
