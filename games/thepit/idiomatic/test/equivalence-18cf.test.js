/**
 * Memory-equivalence gate for collectLootTile (ROM 0x18cf) — the tile-boundary "collect a scoring
 * tile" arm of the actor-movement dispatch. On the final sub-step before the actor crosses
 * into a new tile column it collects two kinds of scoring tile (tile 58 -> +10, tiles 59..61
 * -> +20, the latter gated by an enable flag and a one-shot latch with a guard), awarding
 * score, bumping that kind's pickup counter, blanking the collected cell, and continuing the
 * movement; any other phase or tile is handed to the dig-arm classifier triggerDigReaction.
 *
 * Its declared LIVE-OUT is MEMORY-ONLY: the two pickup counters (0x8081/0x8082), the score
 * and its on-screen digits, the queued sound, the blanked cell, and whatever the movement
 * tail leaves — all work/video RAM. The oracle's residual registers are dead ABI, and because
 * the idiomatic layer dissolves its tails (triggerDigReaction / awardTenPoints called directly, the
 * +20 award and movement tail via the still-frozen oracle) rather than the oracle's
 * stack-threaded jumps, comparing the full register file or SP would false-fail an honest
 * rewrite. So the gate is the RAM state dump only, with ONE wrinkle:
 *
 *   THE STACK SCRATCH. The Pit's stack is real diffed work RAM (entry SP ~0x83fd here). On the
 *   award paths the oracle pushes return addresses and the sound enqueue saves two register
 *   pairs — up to eight dead bytes parked in [SP-8, SP) that the stack-free idiomatic never
 *   writes; and neither side writes ABOVE the entry SP (the movement tail is pop-only). Classic
 *   dead stack scratch, overwritten by the caller's next push before anything reads it — so the
 *   diff excludes exactly the [SP-8, SP) window and compares everything else byte-for-byte. The
 *   real outputs all sit far below the stack (0x8020..0x8082, plus video/colour RAM), so the
 *   window never hides one — the teeth confirm it.
 *
 * SIX checks:
 *   0. IDENTITY (harness) — oracle vs oracle on a captured entry; EQUAL proves the
 *      capture/clone/replay harness reaches 0x18cf in a real attract run.
 *   1. EQUAL (real dispatches) — every captured attract dispatch leaves identical state
 *      outside the stack scratch. Attract only ever takes the decline path into triggerDigReaction.
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted branch sweep) — force every branch identically on both arms: the
 *      boundary gate, tile 58, tiles 59..61 across enabled / latch-open / first-open-guard,
 *      and the unrecognised-tile declines.
 *   3. NON-VACUOUS — on a tile-58 award entry, the idiomatic run actually bumps the counter,
 *      blanks the cell, and queues the sound (so a no-op twin cannot pass), and agrees with
 *      the oracle.
 *   4. TEETH (counter) — a twin that fails to bump the pickup counter is CAUGHT at 0x8081.
 *   5. TEETH (blank) — a twin that stamps the wrong tile over the collected cell is CAUGHT at
 *      the cell.
 *
