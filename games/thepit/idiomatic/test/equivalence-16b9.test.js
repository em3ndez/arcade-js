/**
 * Memory-equivalence gate for locateActorCellCheckGoal (ROM 0x16b9) — route a moving actor's horizontal step:
 * if it has reached the goal terminator tile, latch the goal crossing and walk it on; otherwise
 * resolve the terrain step it is entering.
 *
 * Given the actor's tile row (register live-in, surfaced as `row`) and its sprite/state code
 * (surfaced as `spriteCode`), it locates the tilemap cell under the actor, publishes the tile
 * column (PLAYER_TILE_COL) and the cell pointer (PLAYER_CELL_PTR), and either latches the goal
 * crossing (GOAL_TILE_LATCH + PIT_CROSS_ACTIVE) and hands off to advanceActorWalk, or hands
 * the step to the terrain-collision handler resolveActorTerrainStep. Both callees are already idiomatic, so
 * locateActorCellCheckGoal calls them directly with honest args (cell pointer + biased column); no register
 * hand-off survives. Its declared LIVE-OUT is MEMORY-ONLY.
 *
 * THE STACK SCRATCH. The comparison runs the still-frozen ORACLE locateActorCellCheckGoal, whose tail-jumps
 * thread through the Z80 stack (m.call, and, on the terrain handler's collect paths, register
 * saves), against the stack-free idiomatic handoff chain. Any dead bytes the oracle parks just
 * below the entry stack pointer (The Pit's stack is real diffed work RAM, entry SP 0x83fd here)
 * are classic scratch — overwritten by the caller's next push before anything reads them. The
 * diff excludes exactly that [SP-N, SP) window and compares everything else byte-for-byte; every
 * real output sits far below (0x806e..0x80e7 plus video RAM), so the window can never hide one —
 * the teeth confirm it. Registers/flags/pc/SP are excluded (the honest-signature contract); the
 * two register live-ins default to the registers so a no-arg call reproduces the oracle exactly.
 *
 * Attract only ever reaches the terrain-step path (the goal latch stays clear and no goal tile is
 * ever peeked), so real captured dispatches drive that arm and CRAFTED entries drive the goal
 * arms attract never produces: a goal tile poked into the cell one step ahead, into the cell one
 * full row further down, and the already-at-terminator short-circuit (latch set + sprite 0x17).
 *
 * Checks:
 *   0. IDENTITY (harness) — oracle vs oracle on a captured attract dispatch; proves the
 *      capture/clone/replay harness reaches 0x16b9 in a real run.
 *   1. EQUAL (real dispatches) — every captured attract dispatch leaves identical state outside
 *      the stack scratch (the terrain-step routing).
 *   2. NON-VACUOUS — a real dispatch actually publishes the computed tile column and cell pointer
 *      and routes to the terrain handler (the latch stays clear); a no-op twin cannot pass.
 *   3. EQUAL (crafted goal ahead) — a goal tile in the cell one step ahead latches the crossing
 *      and advances the walk, identical to the oracle.
 *   4. EQUAL (crafted goal one row down) — the same for the cell one full row further down.
 *   5. EQUAL (crafted head short-circuit) — latch set + sprite 0x17 latches the sprite code and
 *      advances, identical to the oracle.
 *   6. TEETH (cell pointer) — a twin that corrupts the published cell pointer is CAUGHT at
 *      PLAYER_CELL_PTR.
 *   7. TEETH (goal latch) — on a crafted goal entry, a twin that skips the goal latch is CAUGHT at
 *      GOAL_TILE_LATCH.
