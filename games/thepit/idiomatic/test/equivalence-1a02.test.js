/**
 * Memory-equivalence gate for stepObjectAndResolveTile (ROM 0x1a02) — step the tracked object one frame along
 * its climb axis and resolve the tile it lands on (collect loot / carve / block / keep moving).
 *
 * From the object's position counters (plus the caller's column bias) it derives the tile cell,
 * publishes the under-tile, and resolves it: loot on a boundary is scored + blanked; solid tiles
 * defer the frame; a diggable-terrain mismatch arms the carve reaction (and records a neighbour);
 * anything else advances one step and cycles the walk sprite. Its declared LIVE-OUT is
 * MEMORY-ONLY. The column bias — its one genuine register live-in — is surfaced as the columnBias
 * parameter (defaulting to the register, so a no-arg call reproduces the oracle).
 *
 * THE STACK SCRATCH. The comparison runs the still-frozen ORACLE stepObjectAndResolveTile — whose every terminal
 * threads through the stack (m.call the epilogue, and push16 + m.call the score/sound awards) —
 * against the stack-free idiomatic routine, which calls its already-idiomatic callees
 * (stageObjectSpriteRecord, awardTenPoints, awardTwentyPoints) directly. The two therefore leave
 * different dead bytes just below the entry stack pointer (The Pit's stack is real diffed work RAM,
 * ~0x83fd here) — classic dead scratch, overwritten by the caller's next push before anything
 * reads it. The diff excludes exactly that [SP-N, SP) window and compares everything else
 * byte-for-byte; every real output sits far below the stack (0x8020..0x80e7 plus video RAM), so
 * the window can never hide one — the teeth confirm it. Registers/flags/pc/SP are excluded per the
 * honest-signature contract (the idiomatic layer does not preserve the Z80 register/step trace).
 *
 * Checks:
 *   0. IDENTITY (harness) — oracle vs oracle on a captured attract entry; proves capture/replay
 *      reaches 0x1a02 in a real run.
 *   1. EQUAL (real dispatches) — every captured attract dispatch leaves identical state outside the
 *      stack scratch. The demo's object is descending, so these take the keep-moving/advance arm.
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted loot) — force the boundary + a 10-point loot tile: both award, tally, blank
 *      the cell and keep moving, identical.
 *   3. EQUAL (crafted solid) — force a solid tile: both defer the frame, identical.
 *   4. EQUAL (crafted diggable sweep) — force each diggable code at an off-boundary phase: both
 *      resolve match (keep moving) vs mismatch (arm the carve reaction + neighbour lookup)
 *      identically; at least one drives the carve reaction, proving that arm is exercised.
 *   5. EQUAL (crafted top-rung) — force the top-rung column: both defer (latching the spawn flag
 *      when the second-loot latch is set), identical.
 *   6. NON-VACUOUS — a real dispatch writes the row/column cells, the cell address, the under-tile
 *      and the stepped position (a no-op twin cannot pass), and agrees with the oracle.
 *   7. TEETH (tile) — a twin that publishes the wrong under-tile is CAUGHT at CUR_TILE.
 *   8. TEETH (row) — a twin with a wrong row cell is CAUGHT at PLAYER_TILE_ROW.
 *   9. TEETH (step) — a twin with a wrong stepped position is CAUGHT at PLAYER_X.
