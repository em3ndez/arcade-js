/**
 * Memory-equivalence gate for flagObjectTargetOverlap (ROM 0x2c91) — the overlap-flag tail of the
 * dig/projectile-spawn path. It reads the tracked object (OBJ_X/OBJ_Y) and the
 * freshly-placed target cell (TARGET_X/TARGET_Y), publishes a 0/1 overlap flag to
 * DIG_OVERLAP_HOLD, then hands off to the idiomatic record builder stageDigObjectSpriteRecord
 * (ROM 0x2bd3), which continues into 0x2f71 and unwinds to flagObjectTargetOverlap's caller.
 *
 * CONTRACT. flagObjectTargetOverlap has NO register live-ins — every input is read from RAM — and its
 * only own side effect is the DIG_OVERLAP_HOLD byte; the record-build tail is delegated to the
 * idiomatic stageDigObjectSpriteRecord, which is memory-equivalent to the oracle's tail
 * but returns via plain JS rather than the Z80 stack dance. So the gate is a RAM-only
 * diff via dumpState: pc/SP and value-registers are the dead Z80 trace and are NOT
 * compared (the idiomatic tail deliberately does not reproduce them), and the dead
 * stack-scratch window at the top of work RAM is excluded for the same reason (nothing
 * flagObjectTargetOverlap touches lives there).
 *
 * REACHABILITY. This tail is genuinely reached in attract (~62 dispatches per 3000
 * frames), so the entry is captured live via the dispatch/​m.call override hook, then
 * the four input bytes are swept identically on both sides to exercise the overlap
 * window (the natural entry never overlaps, so the flag=1 arm is crafted).
 *
 * Checks:
 *   0. HARNESS   — capture a real 0x2c91 entry; the oracle run is deterministic
 *      (oracle vs oracle over the whole state is identical). Proves the capture/clone
 *      plumbing reaches a real state and the delegated tail is stable.
 *   1. EQUAL (real entry) — flagObjectTargetOverlap == oracle over RAM (minus dead stack scratch).
 *   2. EQUAL (branch/boundary/wrap set) — crafted inputs that hit every arm of the
 *      overlap test (row-miss, X-not-right, X-in-band, X-past-band, both wraps).
 *   3. EQUAL (sweep) — exhaustive over the compared X axis for every boundary cell X,
 *      plus an exhaustive row-equality sweep including the +12 wrap. DIG_OVERLAP_HOLD also
 *      cross-checked against a from-first-principles truth table each time.
 *   4. TEETH (inverted flag) — a twin that publishes the opposite flag is CAUGHT at
 *      DIG_OVERLAP_HOLD, in BOTH directions (overlap input and non-overlap input).
 *   5. TEETH (band off-by-one) — a twin whose X window is one pixel too wide is CAUGHT
 *      at DIG_OVERLAP_HOLD on the exact boundary cell it mis-classifies.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/thepit/idiomatic/test/equivalence-2c91.test.js
