/**
 * Memory-equivalence gate for loc_48c4 (ROM 0x48c4, The Pit) — the nine-cell
 * colour-RAM column recolour that cycles its colour one step per call.
 *
 * The routine seats the fill length / colour / target cell, then drives three cell
 * helpers — rowColToTileOffset (0x3dae), deriveTileWriteCursors (0x3dc9) and the
 * column fill fillColourColumn (0x3e01) — all already decompiled in idiomatic/. The
 * idiomatic rewrite calls them DIRECTLY (a plain JS call), where the oracle reached
 * them through the real Z80 stack: it pushed a literal return address before each of
 * the first two helper calls and tail-jumped into the fill, whose own `ret` unwound
 * to loc_48c4's caller.
 *
 * Because the direct calls have no Z80 stack frame, the idiomatic routine no longer
 * pushes those return addresses, no longer advances SP, and no longer rets — so pc,
 * SP, the value registers, and the dead return-address scratch just below the entry
 * stack pointer all legitimately differ from the oracle. The routine's DECLARED
 * live-out is memory-only (the recoloured colour-RAM column), so this gate compares
 * OBSERVABLE equivalence: the work / colour RAM the routine actually affects, plus pc
 * and SP, EXCLUDING the dead stack-scratch window [SP-2, SP) and the value registers.
 * To line pc + SP up with the oracle (which rets internally via the tail fill), the
 * candidate is followed by one m.ret() modelling that same tail return.
 *
 * The oracle's only stack traffic is one 2-byte return-address slot at [SP-2, SP),
 * reused by both helper pushes (the three callees push nothing and end in `ret`), so
 * the excluded window is exactly two bytes.
 *
 * The routine is dispatched from the dig / wall-collision core (loc_03e8) during the
 * ordinary boot/attract run, so entries are CAPTURED from that run, never constructed.
 *
 *   0. HARNESS  — capture a real dispatch and confirm the oracle run is deterministic
 *                 (oracle vs oracle -> identical whole state + pc). Proves the plumbing.
 *   1. EQUAL    — idiomatic vs oracle over the observable contract (RAM outside the
 *                 stack scratch + pc + SP), from the first real captured dispatch, and
 *                 the seated inputs + painted column hold the expected values.
 *   2. NON-VACUOUS — the oracle really does the work (fill length 9, target column 6 /
 *                 row 10, colour advanced with bit 3 held clear, the colour painted down
 *                 the column) AND the excluded window genuinely holds the oracle's dead
 *                 return-address scratch that the idiomatic routine does not reproduce —
 *                 so the exclusion is load-bearing, not vacuous.
 *   3. TEETH    — a twin that drops the colour advance MUST be caught, naming BOARD_MODE.
 *   4. REALISM  — replay every real dispatch over a longer run; observable-equal to the
 *                 oracle on each.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/thepit/idiomatic/test/equivalence-48c4.test.js
