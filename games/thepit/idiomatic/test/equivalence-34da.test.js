/**
 * Memory-equivalence gate for advanceDormantMover (ROM 0x34da, The Pit) — the mover
 * housekeeping that bumps a free-running tick counter (0x8090) each call, on the
 * once-every-256 wrap hands off to the periodic refresh (loc_34f0), and otherwise
 * advances a slower second counter (0x8085) on every 4th tick while holding that
 * counter's bit 3 clear.
 *
 * WHY THIS ISN'T unitEquivalence (same two reasons as its sibling loc_34f0):
 *   1. UNREACHED IN ATTRACT. advanceDormantMover's caller (loc_319d's tick housekeeping) is a
 *      gameplay path — hooking 0x34da over 3000+ attract frames yields zero
 *      dispatches. There is no natural entry for the shared unitEquivalence harness
 *      to snapshot, and force-injecting one would corrupt the host stack.
 *   2. DEAD, PATH-DEPENDENT WORKING REGISTERS. The accumulator the oracle leaves is
 *      the refresh's value on a wrap, the low tick bits on a skipped tick, or the
 *      new second-counter value on the 4th tick — all dead ABI (the caller reaches
 *      here only by tail-jump). unitEquivalence diffs the FULL register file, so it
 *      would false-fail a correct rewrite on those dead registers.
 * So, like loc_34f0 and advanceRandom, this gate compares the DECLARED live-out —
 * work RAM only — via a memory diff, and uses the machine-factory overrides hook to
 * CAPTURE real attract states (clone, run both) rather than to dispatch the target.
 *
 * The one wrinkle: on the WRAP path the oracle vectors into the still-oracle refresh
 * (loc_34f0), which models the Z80 stack — it pushes a two-byte return address for
 * its generator call just below SP. The cycle-free idiomatic routine calls the
 * idiomatic refresh directly and never touches the stack, so those two dead stack
 * bytes are excluded from the RAM diff (the dropped stack ABI, read by nothing).
 *
 * FIVE checks:
 *   1. EXHAUSTIVE — over all 65,536 (tick, second-counter) pairs, seed both bytes
 *      identically on both sides and confirm work RAM matches the oracle. This
 *      sweeps all three paths (the do-nothing tick, the 4th-tick advance, and the
 *      wrap→refresh) and every bit-3 boundary of the second counter.
 *   2. SCOPE — on one state of each path type the oracle changes ONLY its expected
 *      addresses (plus the wrap's dead stack push); nothing else. Licenses the
 *      memory-only contract.
 *   3. EQUAL (real captured attract states) — clone the running attract machine at a
 *      spread of frames and confirm idiomatic == oracle on each real state.
 *   4. WRAP GENERATOR SWEEP — on the wrap beat, over a spread of generator states,
 *      the refresh's reseed matches the oracle (the wrap path delegates correctly).
 *   5. TEETH — three broken twins (drop the bit-3 hold, skip the refresh on a wrap,
 *      never advance the second counter) MUST all be caught.
 *
