/**
 * Memory-equivalence gate for paintPlayfieldStripCol1Row11 (ROM 0x4816) — the round-setup strip painter:
 * it places a tile-cell cursor at column 1 / row 11, resolves the cell's addresses,
 * fills a 10-cell vertical tilemap strip from the ROM table at 0x494f (top cell a fixed
 * cap, the nine below walked back through the table), then paints the same 10 cells with
 * colour 0.
 *
 * CRAFTED-ENTRY, because attract never dispatches paintPlayfieldStripCol1Row11 (it is round setup — the
 * caller holdRoundIntroLoop/setUpRoundAndHoldIntro only runs once a game starts). So instead of hooking the
 * target itself, we capture REAL machine states at a routine paintPlayfieldStripCol1Row11 shares and that
 * attract DOES dispatch — loc_3dae, the shared row/col -> offset calc (first entered
 * ~frame 81) — clone at its entry, and run oracle-vs-idiomatic paintPlayfieldStripCol1Row11 on those real,
 * in-distribution states. paintPlayfieldStripCol1Row11 supplies all of its own inputs (it overwrites the
 * cursor/count/fill scratch it reads and sets its own source pointer), so any real
 * captured state is a valid entry; the capture just provides a realistic RAM image and
 * a valid stack for the return to pop.
 *
 * OBSERVABLE-EQUIVALENCE CONTRACT. The idiomatic routine dissolved three stale oracle
 * calls into direct calls of their decompiled siblings — rowColToTileOffset (0x3dae),
 * deriveTileWriteCursors (0x3dc9) and fillColourColumn (0x3e01) — which are plain JS
 * calls with no Z80 stack frame. Two consequences the oracle does but the idiomatic no
 * longer does: (a) it no longer pushes those callees' return addresses onto the compared
 * work-RAM stack, and (b) the final colour fill was the oracle's tail `jp` whose `ret`
 * returned to paintPlayfieldStripCol1Row11's caller — as a direct call it just paints and returns, so the
 * idiomatic leaves pc/SP one return short. So the gate models the return with one
 * m.ret() on the candidate (lining pc + SP up with the oracle), compares the observable
 * RAM the strip paints + pc + SP, and EXCLUDES the dead stack-scratch window just below
 * the entry stack pointer and the declared-dead value registers (the honest live-out is
 * memory-only). (In this routine the one retained oracle call — the tilemap fill 0x3ddb,
 * which has no idiomatic form yet — re-pushes the same return-address slot, so the
 * excluded window in fact coincides byte-for-byte; the exclusion is the general dissolve
 * guard, and here the RAM matches through it.)
 *
 * Jobs:
 *   1. EQUAL   — on each captured real entry, oracle and idiomatic leave identical
 *                observable RAM + pc + SP.
 *   2. PAINTED — pre-dirty the 20 target cells, run the oracle, and confirm exactly the
 *                10 tilemap cells and 10 colour cells (plus the scratch) were written —
 *                proof the entries actually exercise the paint, and the footprint.
 *   3. TEETH   — a twin that fills 9 cells instead of 10 MUST be caught, both on the
 *                whole-state contract and specifically at the 10th (unpainted) cell.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/thepit/idiomatic/test/equivalence-4816.test.js
