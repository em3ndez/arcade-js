/**
 * Memory-equivalence gate for drawGameOverLabel (ROM 0x48e5, The Pit) — the HUD
 * label painter that stamps the nine-character "GAME OVER" run down its text
 * column. It names one tile cell (column 1, row 12), derives that cell's tilemap
 * offset and colour-RAM / video-RAM cursors (rowColToTileOffset, deriveTileWriteCursors),
 * copies the nine glyphs down the video column through the still-oracle copy helper
 * (0x3dea), and paints the nine colour cells (fillColourColumn).
 *
 * WHY THE CONTRACT CHANGED FROM WHOLE-DUMP TO A MODELLED RETURN:
 *
 *   The oracle finishes with a tail-jump into the colour filler (0x3e01), whose own
 *   `ret` unwinds to drawGameOverLabel's caller — so the oracle, as a whole, RETURNS
 *   (it consumes its return address, landing pc at the caller and SP two higher). The
 *   idiomatic routine now calls the already-decompiled colour filler DIRECTLY, which
 *   is a plain JS return and performs no Z80 `ret`. Left alone the candidate therefore
 *   stops with its exit pc and SP still at the routine's entry (the caller's return is
 *   its to close), so pc/SP legitimately differ from the oracle. Per the sound-stub
 *   dissolve (equivalence-4c5f.test.js) the gate models that one return with a single
 *   m.ret() on the candidate, which lines pc + SP up with the oracle. The three address/
 *   fill helpers are direct calls; only the copy helper (0x3dea) is still the oracle,
 *   reached through the registry with its source pointer and return slot, so the one
 *   transient return-address the oracle parks just below the entry SP is reproduced
 *   exactly. The upshot: after the modelled return the WHOLE work RAM matches with no
 *   exclusion, so the gate keeps the full contract — work/video/colour RAM + pc + SP.
 *
 * WHY THIS ROUTINE IS STRAIGHTFORWARD FOR THE GATE:
 *
 *   1. It is entered from the HUD redraw (loc_472c) whenever no player is active —
 *      player count 0, the game-over state — which attract reaches early (0x48e5
 *      first dispatches ~frame 61). So a REAL captured dispatch is available with no
 *      crafted forcing, and the capture confirms player count 0 (the "GAME OVER" arm).
 *
 *   2. It is straight-line: fixed column/row, a fixed colour, a fixed row count, and
 *      a fixed ROM glyph source — no input-dependent branch. So the one real dispatch
 *      exercises the whole path; there is no state-dependent input to sweep.
 *
 * EQUAL is proven on the real captured entry over RAM + pc + SP; the teeth twins — a
 * wrong colour, an off-by-one glyph source that only surfaces in video RAM, a dropped
 * colour-fill effect, and a post-hoc output corruption — are all caught.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/thepit/idiomatic/test/equivalence-48e5.test.js
