/**
 * Memory-equivalence gate for advanceTwoSpriteActor (ROM 0x3748, The Pit) — the per-frame update
 * for the two-sprite actor: dispatch by spawn state (BOARD_END_PHASE) and animation phase
 * (PLAY_PHASE_COUNTER), and on the running phases march + walk-animate the actor inline
 * before staging its two sprite records.
 *
 * THE CONTRACT — OBSERVABLE RAM ONLY. Every arm is a TAIL JUMP: the oracle hands the
 * frame to a callee whose `ret` returns to advanceTwoSpriteActor's own caller. The idiomatic routine
 * dissolves each tail jump into a direct JS call to the already-decompiled callee
 * (spawnAltPhaseActor / advanceOrRebuildTwinActor / spawnTwinActor / stageActorSpriteRecords), which run
 * stack-free — they no longer march SP, set pc, or leave the oracle's residual value
 * registers. The steady mover at 0x3a13 is likewise the decompiled advanceActorMovers,
 * called directly and stack-free. So pc, SP and the value registers diverge from the
 * oracle BY CONSTRUCTION and are excluded — the gate compares the full RAM dump (work +
 * colour + video + attr/sprite), which is exactly what the display reads. The one arm
 * that pushes onto the Z80 stack (the alt-phase spawn's sound request) parks a few dead
 * bytes just below the entry SP that the stack-free idiomatic routine does not reproduce;
 * that window (top of work RAM, no named/observable cell lives there) is excluded too.
 *
 * REACHABILITY. In a 4000-frame attract run 0x3748 dispatches ~3700 times and 5 of its 6
 * arms occur naturally — the inline move (phases 0..2), the seed+move (3..5), the
 * rebuild-at-edge (6..8), the twin spawn (9), and the steady mover (10+). The sixth, the
 * alt-phase spawn (BOARD_END_PHASE != 0), is never reached in attract, and the one-shot seed
 * body (phases 3..5 with the actor not yet present) fires only twice — so both are also
 * exercised from CRAFTED entries: a real captured state with BOARD_END_PHASE / PLAY_PHASE_COUNTER /
 * PLAYER_ACTIVE poked identically on both sides.
 *
 * Checks:
 *   1. EQUAL (natural) — every captured attract dispatch, oracle vs idiomatic, full RAM
 *      identical; asserts all 5 natural arms were seen so none passes vacuously.
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted alt-phase spawn) — BOARD_END_PHASE poked to force the spawn body (and
 *      its sound-request stack push) and the already-active hand-off; RAM identical
 *      outside the dead stack window, plus a positive check the actor was marked live.
 *   3. EQUAL (crafted seed body) — PLAY_PHASE_COUNTER in 3..5 with PLAYER_ACTIVE cleared, so
 *      the one-shot seed runs; RAM identical, plus positive checks it seeded the step
 *      vector / presence flag / start cell.
 *   4. TEETH (bad march) — a twin that mis-places the twin sprite whenever a march
 *      actually happened is CAUGHT at the twin's X byte.
 *   5. TEETH (bad seed) — a twin that seeds the wrong start cell on the seed body is
 *      CAUGHT at PLAYER_Y.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/thepit/idiomatic/test/equivalence-3748.test.js
