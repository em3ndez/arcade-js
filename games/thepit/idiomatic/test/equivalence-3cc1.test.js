/**
 * Memory-equivalence gate for drawSharedPanel (ROM 0x3cc1, The Pit) — the shared fixed-panel
 * layout: it stamps the left edge column and both players' score HUD, places three
 * labelled tile/colour runs (a ROM label strip at column 7 row 9; a dynamic glyph from
 * the game-state byte plus a filled strip at column 9 row 13; a second ROM label strip
 * plus a colour-column accent at column 13 row 9), then stamps the right edge column
 * and the playfield column with its trim.
 *
 * WHY A CRAFTED ENTRY. This layout is only reached from the status-screen builders
 * (0x3bec / 0x4df8), so it never dispatches in a plain attract run (confirmed: 0 hits
 * in 5000 frames). Per the crafted-entry method the gate instead runs it from a REAL
 * board-setup machine state: its own first callee, the edge-column stamper 0x46f4, DOES
 * dispatch during attract's board setup, so the state captured at 0x46f4's entry is the
 * exact machine state 0x3cc1 hands to its first call — the most faithful possible entry,
 * with a valid stack and an in-play work-RAM configuration. The routine is straight-line
 * with no input-dependent branch, so that one entry exercises the whole path.
 *
 * THE CONTRACT IS OBSERVABLE-RAM EQUIVALENCE, STACK-SCRATCH EXCLUDED. The registry
 * resolves every m.call to the frozen translated oracle, so the oracle run reaches its
 * HUD/score helpers as deeply-nested translated routines that leave dead return-address
 * scratch on the work stack; the idiomatic routine calls those same helpers as direct
 * JS, so its stack activity is shallower and the dead scratch differs. That scratch is
 * dead by definition (the stack lives at the top of work RAM, 0x83ff down; nothing reads
 * it back). Measured, the ENTIRE divergence is eight bytes in [0x83f5, 0x83fc] at the
 * top of the stack — every video cell, every colour cell, and all meaningful work RAM
 * (including the plotter staging cells 0x8055-0x8060) is byte-identical. So the diff
 * compares the whole state dump EXCEPT a stack-scratch window at the top of work RAM,
 * and excludes pc + SP + the dead register file (the honest-signature live-out is
 * memory-only; the oracle's tail-jump return is not modelled here because pc/SP are out
 * of contract). The oracle writes nothing meaningful in [0x8130, 0x83e0), so the window
 * hides nothing real — teeth prove it.
 *
 * Checks:
 *   0. HARNESS  — a real 0x46f4 board-setup entry is captured; the oracle run of 0x3cc1
 *      is deterministic (oracle vs oracle identical outside the stack window).
 *   1. EQUAL    — idiomatic == oracle over the observable RAM (video + colour + work RAM
 *      minus the stack scratch), and the layout really ran (staging cells + a nonzero,
 *      matching count of display cells changed).
 *   2. SENTINEL — over a marker-filled colour+video background every write is a real
 *      change; the oracle writes the same set of cells as idiomatic, non-vacuously.
 *   3. TEETH    — three structural twins, each differing from the routine by ONE thing:
 *      a wrong run-1 colour (caught in colour RAM), a shifted run-1 glyph source (caught
 *      downstream in video RAM through the still-oracle copy helper), and a dropped right
 *      playfield column (caught as unpainted video/colour cells).
 *
 * Run: node --test games/thepit/idiomatic/test/equivalence-3cc1.test.js
