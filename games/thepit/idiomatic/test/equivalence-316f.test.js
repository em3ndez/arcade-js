/**
 * Memory-equivalence gate for advanceObjectMover2 (ROM 0x316f) — the object-2 half of the two-object
 * mover pass: stage object 2's record into the shared mover scratch, step the mover on it,
 * copy it back, stage object 2's sprite (three bytes verbatim + a coordinate-biased fourth),
 * then tail into the shared per-frame actor update.
 *
 * CONTRACT. The routine's declared live-out is MEMORY-ONLY — object 2's record, the mover's
 * writes, and the four staged sprite bytes. It is reached by tail-jump and continues by
 * tail-jump, so no caller reads a value register back; the gate compares work RAM (dumpState)
 * and excludes the Z80 pc/SP/value-registers the honest-signature rewrite does not preserve.
 *
 * THE TAIL RUNS FOR REAL ON BOTH SIDES. advanceObjectMover2's last act was a stale m.call into the
 * shared actor update 0x3748; that call has now been DISSOLVED to a direct call to the decompiled
 * advanceTwoSpriteActor. So the tail runs on both arms — the oracle m.call's the frozen registry copy,
 * the idiomatic arm calls the imported idiomatic function — and the two are memory-equivalent
 * (equivalence-3748), so the tail's work cancels in the diff, leaving advanceObjectMover2's own work
 * compared. The mover (stepEnemyMover) likewise runs for real on both sides. On the rare arrival/
 * capture path the tail chains into the round-boundary transition, which resets the stack and
 * converges at two never-returning leaves (0x031a, 0x01f9); those are stubbed identically on both
 * clones, and a once-per-frame interrupt tick drains any frame-wait.
 *
 * DEAD STACK SCRATCH — the oracle marshals its calls through the Z80 stack (and the round-boundary
 * chain resets SP to 0x83ff and pushes down) while the stack-free idiomatic JS does not. Those
 * bytes are classic dead stack scratch, so the RAM diff excludes the chain window near 0x83ff and a
 * shallow window just below the entry stack pointer, and compares everything else byte-for-byte.
 *
 * THE BIAS IS ZERO IN ATTRACT, so the coordinate-bias arm of the fourth sprite byte is exercised
 * by a crafted entry that pokes a nonzero SPRITE_COORD_BIAS identically on both sides.
 *
 * Checks:
 *   0. HARNESS — capture real 0x316f attract dispatches; the oracle run is deterministic.
 *   1. EQUAL (real dispatches) — advanceObjectMover2 == oracle over RAM on every captured entry, with a
 *      positive check that the staged sprite is object 2's record bytes (+ zero bias).
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted nonzero bias) — with SPRITE_COORD_BIAS poked nonzero the fourth sprite
 *      byte still matches the oracle, and equals record[3] + bias.
 *   3. TEETH (corrupted sprite byte) — a twin that flips a staged sprite byte is CAUGHT.
 *   4. TEETH (dropped coordinate bias) — from the nonzero-bias entry, a twin that stages the
 *      fourth byte without the bias is CAUGHT at that byte.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/thepit/idiomatic/test/equivalence-316f.test.js
