/**
 * Memory-equivalence gate for loc_14cd (ROM 0x14cd) — locate the object's tilemap cell, latch a goal
 * crossing if the goal is just ahead, else resolve the tile under it.
 *
 * loc_14cd is the positioning front of the tile-under-object path: from the object's screen row (a
 * register live-in, surfaced as `row`) plus its row/column coordinates it derives the tilemap cell
 * (publishing OBJ_TILE_COL + ACTOR_CELL_PTR), clears the ahead-tile scratch (NEXT_TILE), then either
 * latches the two goal flags and walks (when the cell ahead is the goal tile and the object is
 * cross-axis grid-aligned) or hands the whole step to the resolver loc_1515. Its declared LIVE-OUT is
 * MEMORY-ONLY.
 *
 * STACK-TOP WINDOW. loc_14cd itself pushes nothing, but the loot awards inside the delegated resolver
 * reach the score adder through the oracle's ordinary calls (0x467b / 0x4683), which park a return
 * address the stack-free idiomatic cascade never writes. As measured for loc_1515, the oracle leaves
 * at most a handful of dead bytes just below the entry stack pointer, so the diff excludes a small
 * [SP-16, SP) window — well above the work + video RAM this routine writes — and compares everything
 * else byte-for-byte. Registers/flags/pc/SP are the honest-signature dead live-out and never compared;
 * the `row` live-in defaults to the register so a no-arg call reproduces the oracle.
 *
 * REACHED IN ATTRACT. Unlike its resolver siblings, loc_14cd IS dispatched during attract (measured 61
 * dispatches in 4000 frames), so the gate validates every real captured entry directly. The arms the
 * demo never drives — the goal-ahead latch and the loot/push cases — are covered by crafted entries
 * built on real attract clones (a valid stack, video RAM, object record) with the row / column / cell
 * inputs poked: the object's cell is forced onto an isolated video-RAM cell so the tile under it and
 * the tile ahead are controllable, and the under tile is swept over all 256 ids across every sub-offset.
 *
 * Checks:
 *   0. HARNESS — confirm attract dispatches 0x14cd, capture real entries, and oracle-vs-oracle on a
 *      real entry is deterministic (the capture/clone/replay plumbing works).
 *   1. EQUAL (real captured entries) — idiomatic == oracle over every real 0x14cd dispatch.
 *   2. EQUAL (under-tile sweep) — every under-tile id 0..255 across every sub-offset (the delegated
 *      resolve): both loot kinds when aligned, and the terrain delegation everywhere else.
 *   3. EQUAL (goal-ahead latch) — the cell ahead is the goal tile and the object is cross-axis aligned:
 *      both goal flags latch and the walk step runs, identical to the oracle.
 *   4. NON-VACUOUS — a crafted entry really writes RAM; a no-op twin cannot pass.
 *   5. TEETH (goal latch) — a twin that drops the goal-tile latch is CAUGHT at GOAL_TILE_LATCH.
 *   6. TEETH (ahead scratch) — a twin that skips clearing the ahead-tile scratch is CAUGHT at NEXT_TILE.
 *   7. TEETH (cell column) — a twin that corrupts the published tile column is CAUGHT at OBJ_TILE_COL.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/thepit/idiomatic/test/equivalence-14cd.test.js
