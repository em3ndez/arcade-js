/**
 * Memory-equivalence gate for reseedMoverCadenceAndRearmState (ROM 0x34f0, The Pit) — the periodic
 * refresh that takes a fresh pseudo-random draw, forces its high bit set, stores
 * it into the random/animation byte (0x808b), and re-arms the actor state/timer
 * byte (0x8084) to 9.
 *
 * WHY THIS ISN'T unitEquivalence. Two facts shape the gate:
 *   1. UNREACHED IN ATTRACT. The chain that reaches reseedMoverCadenceAndRearmState (the mover
 *      housekeeping's once-per-256-tick wrap) is a gameplay-only path — hooking
 *      0x34f0 over 3000+ attract frames yields zero dispatches. So there is no
 *      natural entry for the shared unitEquivalence harness to snapshot, and
 *      force-injecting one would corrupt the host stack (the oracle ends with an
 *      unbalanced return).
 *   2. NEAR-LEAF WITH DEAD WORKING REGISTERS. reseedMoverCadenceAndRearmState reads no caller input; its
 *      only input is the generator state in memory. The oracle leaves working
 *      registers behind (the generator step's residue) and pops the stack on
 *      return; every one of those is dead ABI. unitEquivalence diffs the FULL
 *      register file, so it would false-fail a correct idiomatic rewrite on those
 *      dead registers — exactly the case the pipeline warns about.
 * So, like its sibling near-leaf advanceRandom (0x4b1a), this gate compares the
 * DECLARED live-out — work RAM + the accumulator — via firstStateDiff, and it uses
 * the machine-factory overrides hook to CAPTURE real attract states (clone, run
 * both) rather than to dispatch the target.
 *
 * The one wrinkle: the oracle models the Z80 stack (it pushes a return address for
 * its generator call), so it writes two bytes just below SP that the cycle-free
 * idiomatic routine does not. That dead stack-push window is excluded from the RAM
 * diff — it is the dropped stack ABI, read by nothing.
 *
 * FOUR checks:
 *   1. EQUAL (real captured attract states) — clone the running attract machine at
 *      a spread of frames, run the oracle and reseedMoverCadenceAndRearmState on independent clones of
 *      each, and diff work RAM (minus the stack push) + the accumulator.
 *   2. SCOPE — the oracle changes ONLY {0x800d,0x800e,0x8084,0x808b} plus the
 *      stack-push window; nothing else. This licenses the memory-only contract.
 *   3. EXHAUSTIVE — over all 65,536 generator states, seed both bytes identically
 *      on both sides and confirm the two written bytes (0x808b,0x8084) and the two
 *      advanced generator bytes (0x800d,0x800e) match the oracle, and 0x808b's high
 *      bit is always set. Covers the all-zero reseed branch too.
 *   4. TEETH — a twin that drops the high-bit force (stores the raw draw) and a
 *      twin that arms the state byte to the wrong value MUST both be caught.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/thepit/idiomatic/test/equivalence-34f0.test.js
