/**
 * Equivalence test for loc_47e1 (ROM 0x47e1) — the fixed vertical HUD/status panel
 * painter: seed the shared tile-plotter params and drive its five plot helpers to stamp
 * one tile column + colour column at screen column 1, row 12.
 *
 * loc_47e1 is only invoked while a game is running (round setup calls it for the 1-/2-
 * player modes; the in-play HUD loops call it), so it is NEVER dispatched during a plain
 * attract run — the natural-capture harness (unitEquivalence) would find no entry. This
 * is therefore a CRAFTED-ENTRY gate, the accepted fallback for an unreached arm:
 *
 *   - Capture a real mid-attract machine state (by hooking loc_3dae, which IS reached
 *     early in attract) so the one input the routine actually reads, the secondary
 *     game-state byte at 0x8002, and the ROM tables are all realistic.
 *   - Craft the loc_47e1 entry from it: give it a clean cold-boot stack (sp = 0x83ff)
 *     with one caller return address pushed, so the oracle's tail hand-off has somewhere
 *     to return.
 *   - Run the ORACLE on one clone and the idiomatic loc_47e1 on another and diff the
 *     OBSERVABLE contract.
 *
 * OBSERVABLE CONTRACT (why not the whole machine anymore). The dissolve replaced three
 * `m.call` helpers (0x3dae rowColToTileOffset, 0x3dc9 deriveTileWriteCursors, 0x3e01
 * fillColourColumn) with direct idiomatic calls. Those calls drop the Z80 return-address
 * pushes and — for the tail — the helper's `ret`, so the idiomatic routine leaves pc at
 * its entry value and SP two below the oracle's (the oracle's tail ret pops the crafted
 * caller return; the idiomatic plain-return does not). The leftover value registers are
 * likewise the routine's dead ABI now that the register-marshalling helpers no longer run
 * inline. So the gate compares the painted work/colour/video/sprite RAM — the routine's
 * only live-out — EXCLUDING pc, SP, the value registers, and the dead stack-scratch window
 * just below the entry SP (modelled the way equivalence-4c5f.test.js excludes its dead
 * saved-register bytes). The two remaining oracle helpers (0x3dea, 0x3ddb) are called
 * identically on both sides, so their stack effects cancel; the painted RAM is byte-for-
 * byte identical.
 *
 * TEETH (a green gate must be able to fail):
 *   - a broken twin of loc_47e1 that paints with the wrong fill byte MUST be caught;
 *   - corrupting one painted colour cell after the oracle runs MUST be caught.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/thepit/idiomatic/test/equivalence-47e1.test.js
