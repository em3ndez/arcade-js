/**
 * Equivalence gate for spawnTwinActor (ROM 0x3984) — the pending-spawn init of a
 * two-body actor (figure + twin).
 *
 * spawnTwinActor stamps an eight-cell tile block into video+colour RAM, seeds a primary
 * actor record and its mirrored twin, then hands off to stageActorSpriteRecords
 * (ROM 0x3a4c) to stage both records into the sprite buffer. Its contract is
 * OBSERVABLE MEMORY: the tile+colour block, the two seeded records, and the two
 * staged sprite records the hand-off writes.
 *
 * THE DISSOLVE. The idiomatic routine used to end with `return m.call(0x3a4c)`,
 * invoking the still-translated copier through the registry so its `ret` returned
 * to our caller. That stale boundary is gone: it now imports and directly calls the
 * already-decompiled stageActorSpriteRecords(m). The removed boundary was a TAIL
 * JUMP (`jp 0x3a4c`), which — unlike a `call` — pushes NOTHING onto the stack, so
 * there is no dead stack scratch to reconcile (STACK_SCRATCH = 0 below). The ONLY
 * ABI divergence the dissolve introduces is pc/SP: the oracle path still runs the
 * copier's internal `ret` (and, on the not-pending early-return, its own `ret z`),
 * while the stack-free idiomatic routine models both as a plain JS return. Each
 * oracle path performs exactly ONE `ret`, so — as in equivalence-4c5f.test.js after
 * the sound-stub dissolve — the gate runs one m.ret() on the candidate to line pc +
 * SP up with the oracle, then compares RAM (outside the empty stack window) + pc +
 * SP. Value registers are dead ABI and excluded.
 *
 * Inputs are CAPTURED, not constructed: the routine is hooked in a real attract run
 * and the machine is cloned at every true dispatch. In a 4000-frame run it is entered
 * ~173 times — most with no pending spawn (early-return) and two with a pending
 * request that run the full spawn body. Both classes are replayed.
 *
 *   1. EQUAL — for every captured dispatch, run oracle vs spawnTwinActor on independent
 *      clones of the same entry state and diff RAM + pc + SP; all must be identical.
 *      Asserts at least one body-run capture is present, so the spawn body (and the
 *      dissolved hand-off) is actually exercised.
 *   2. TEETH (wrong timer seed) — a twin that seeds the actor timer one off, but ONLY
 *      on the body-run dispatches, MUST be caught at the timer byte. Because it
 *      diverges only when the body runs, catching it also proves a real body-run
 *      state was captured (an all-early-return set would let it pass).
 *   3. TEETH (mis-staged hand-off) — a twin whose staged sprite record is off by one
 *      (as a mis-wired or wrong-argument callee would produce), only on body-run,
 *      MUST be caught at the sprite slot. This is the dissolve-specific tooth: it
 *      proves the gate still watches the copier's staged output, so a broken direct
 *      call cannot slip through.
 *
 * Run: node --test games/thepit/idiomatic/test/equivalence-3984.test.js
