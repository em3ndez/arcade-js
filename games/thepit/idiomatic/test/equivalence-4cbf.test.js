/**
 * Memory-equivalence gate for submitPlayerHighScore (ROM 0x4cbf) — the end-of-round
 * step that offers a finishing player's score to the "BEST SCORES TODAY" table and
 * repaints the score readouts. It pre-clears the landed-rank result byte, then
 * delegates to loadPlayerState (make the player's score live), insertHighScore (place
 * it), and renderScoreReadouts (repaint) — all three already decompiled and separately
 * gated, so THIS gate proves the composition: the pre-clear and the correct ordering.
 *
 * The routine writes only memory (the landed-rank byte, the high-score table, the
 * shared player block, and the readout display cells) and reads no register on entry,
 * so it is gated on MEMORY-equivalence — RAM only. pc and SP are EXCLUDED: the oracle
 * tail-returns to its caller (its final delegate rets through to loc_4cbf's own caller),
 * so it leaves pc/SP changed while the stack-free JS does not. The oracle also parks a
 * little dead stack scratch just below the entry stack pointer (its per-delegate return
 * pushes, popped again as it unwinds); that scratch lives in the stack page (0x83xx)
 * while every real write lives far below it (the score block ~0x8028-0x8048 and the
 * readout strip ~0x8283-0x829d top out below 0x8300), so the RAM diff excludes a window
 * at the top of the stack and compares everything else byte-for-byte. The teeth below —
 * caught at 0x8048 and 0x8038 — confirm that window hides no real write.
 *
 * WHY A CRAFTED ENTRY. End-of-round teardown never runs in attract, so 0x4cbf is never
 * dispatched (verified: 0 dispatches over 3000 attract frames). Per the crafted-entry
 * method the gate runs it from a REAL captured attract state (cloned at the first
 * dispatch of the unrelated reached leaf 0x3dae, which gives a valid stack + register
 * file), then pokes its inputs — the selected player, that player's saved score, and the
 * three table records — identically on both sides across the table's placement arms.
 *
 *   0. HARNESS — 0x4cbf is unreached in attract (justifying the craft), a real entry is
 *      captured, and the oracle run is deterministic (oracle vs oracle -> identical RAM).
 *   1. EQUAL (real entry) — submitPlayerHighScore == oracle over RAM on the captured
 *      state's natural values.
 *   2. EQUAL (crafted placement sweep) — player 1/2 x land-rank-1/2/3 / no-placement /
 *      tie, each poked identically both sides, identical RAM; the landed rank matches
 *      the expected placement, and a distinct-value scenario is non-vacuous (the render
 *      actually rewrote the readout cells).
 *   3. TEETH (no pre-clear) — a twin that skips the landed-rank pre-clear is CAUGHT at
 *      the landed-rank byte on a no-placement scenario carrying a stale non-zero rank.
 *   4. TEETH (no repaint) — a twin that skips renderScoreReadouts is CAUGHT (the readout
 *      staging + display cells go stale).
 *   5. TEETH (repaint before insert) — a twin that repaints before inserting is CAUGHT:
 *      the readouts then show the pre-insert table.
 *
