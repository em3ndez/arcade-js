/**
 * Memory-equivalence gate for stampGlyphColumn (ROM 0x2d6b) — the countdown-expiry
 * routine that stamps a fixed five-tile glyph down the dig/target object's map column,
 * paints its colour column, re-arms the object's state timer, and hands off to the
 * background-animation update.
 *
 * The routine's whole effect is memory: five tile cells stamped down one column, five
 * matching colour cells, the per-event latch (0x8078) cleared, the state timer (0x807c)
 * armed to 180 — then a tail hand-off to the still-oracle background update (0x2f71),
 * which reads no register left here and so runs identically on both sides, cancelling
 * out of the diff. The declared live-out is MEMORY-ONLY, so the gate compares RAM only
 * (dumpState); pc, SP and the dead value-registers/flags are excluded per the
 * honest-signature contract (the idiomatic layer does not preserve the Z80 register
 * trace). Both arms end with the identical oracle tail-call, so no stack-scratch window
 * needs excluding — a correct run diffs to exactly zero bytes.
 *
 * HOW IT IS REACHED. 0x2d6b IS dispatched during the attract demo (once, in the
 * dig-object window around frame ~1500-2000); its caller loc_2cb7 fires ~119 times in
 * the same window. The routine reads no timer of its own — the caller checks the reload
 * sentinel and jumps here unconditionally — so any real dig-object entry state is a
 * faithful input. The one input that shapes the output, the object's display-cell
 * pointer (ACTOR_CELL_PTR, 0x806e), is additionally swept across several map positions,
 * poked identically on both sides, to prove the address arithmetic is position-exact.
 *
 * Checks:
 *   0. HARNESS   — capture the genuine 0x2d6b entry and confirm the oracle run is
 *      deterministic (oracle vs oracle -> identical RAM). Proves the capture reaches the
 *      real dispatch and the tail hand-off is reproducible.
 *   1. EQUAL (real entry) — stampGlyphColumn == oracle over RAM, and the five tiles,
 *      five colour cells, cleared latch and armed timer hold their expected values.
 *   2. EQUAL (pointer sweep) — with the display-cell pointer forced to each of several
 *      map positions, both stamp the same glyph + colour column, identical.
 *   3. TEETH (wrong tile)    — a twin with one wrong glyph tile is CAUGHT.
 *   4. TEETH (wrong colour)  — a twin with a wrong colour byte is CAUGHT.
 *   5. TEETH (wrong timer)   — a twin that arms the state timer to 179 is CAUGHT.
 *   6. TEETH (latch left set) — a twin that skips clearing the per-event latch is CAUGHT.
 *
