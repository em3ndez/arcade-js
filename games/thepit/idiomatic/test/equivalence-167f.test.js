/**
 * Memory-equivalence gate for stepObjectRowUnflipped (ROM 0x167f) — advance the tracked object one step
 * along the row axis: derive its tile row and route on it, firing the dig one-shot at the
 * trigger row.
 *
 * Given the caller's position offset (register live-in, surfaced as `offset`), it either
 * defers the whole move (overlap flag set) to the record builder stageObjectSpriteRecord,
 * or pre-loads the object's sprite code (SPRITE_CODE), derives the tile row (OBJ_TILE_ROW)
 * and hands the step to the horizontal-step router locateActorCellCheckGoal — except at the trigger row
 * with the feature latch pending, where it consumes the latch (FEATURE_TILE_LATCH), clears
 * the pending dig spawn (SPAWN_STATE), arms the dig object's phase (DIG_OBJ_STATE) and
 * builds its record via stageDigObjectSpriteRecord. All three callees are already idiomatic,
 * so stepObjectRowUnflipped calls them directly (the row is passed to locateActorCellCheckGoal as an honest arg; nothing
 * is marshalled through registers). Its declared LIVE-OUT is MEMORY-ONLY.
 *
 * THE STACK SCRATCH. The comparison runs the still-frozen ORACLE stepObjectRowUnflipped, whose tail-jumps
 * thread through the Z80 stack (m.call, plus register saves in the deeper still-oracle
 * terrain/background handlers), against the stack-free idiomatic handoff chain. Any dead
 * bytes the oracle parks just below the entry stack pointer (The Pit's stack is real diffed
 * work RAM, entry SP ~0x83fd) are classic scratch — overwritten before anything reads them.
 * The diff excludes exactly that [SP-N, SP) window and compares everything else
 * byte-for-byte; every real output sits far below (0x8069..0x80e7 plus the sprite staging
 * buffer at 0x8220), so the window can never hide one — the teeth confirm it. Registers /
 * flags / pc / SP are excluded (the honest-signature contract); the offset live-in defaults
 * to the register so a no-arg call reproduces the oracle exactly.
 *
 * Attract dispatches stepObjectRowUnflipped during the demo (the row-axis move arm), always reaching the
 * common step, so real captured dispatches drive that arm; CRAFTED entries drive the arms
 * the demo never produces: the deferred arm (overlap flag set), the trigger row with the
 * feature latch clear, and the dig one-shot (trigger row + feature latch pending).
 *
 * Checks:
 *   0. IDENTITY (harness) — oracle vs oracle on a captured attract dispatch; proves the
 *      capture/clone/replay harness reaches 0x167f in a real run.
 *   1. EQUAL (real dispatches) — every captured attract dispatch leaves identical state
 *      outside the stack scratch (the common step).
 *   2. NON-VACUOUS — a real dispatch actually pre-loads the sprite code and publishes the
 *      derived tile row; a no-op twin cannot pass.
 *   3. EQUAL (crafted deferred) — the overlap flag set defers to the record builder,
 *      identical to the oracle.
 *   4. EQUAL (crafted trigger row, latch clear) — the trigger row without the feature latch
 *      continues through the horizontal-step router, identical to the oracle.
 *   5. EQUAL (crafted dig one-shot) — the trigger row with the feature latch pending consumes
 *      the latch, clears the spawn state, arms the dig phase and builds the dig record,
 *      identical to the oracle.
 *   6. TEETH (sprite code) — a twin that corrupts the pre-loaded sprite code is CAUGHT at
 *      SPRITE_CODE.
 *   7. TEETH (dig arming) — on the dig one-shot, a twin that drops the dig-phase arming is
 *      CAUGHT at DIG_OBJ_STATE.
