/**
 * Memory-equivalence gate for advanceDigTarget (ROM 0x2d06) — advance the dig target one step and
 * route on the tile it now covers: embed it into the terrain on solid ground, else re-stage it.
 *
 * The routine advances the target's position (TARGET_Y += 1), builds the video-RAM cell it now
 * covers (row from TARGET_X, column from the advanced position), leaves that cell as the live carve
 * cursor (0x80af), and reads the tile a fixed step ahead of it. Three "solid" codes (42/43/65) route
 * to the embed continuation landDigTarget — the idiomatic routine, called with the cell as an argument —
 * which stamps the wall tile into that cell, requests the dig sound, and resets the target's small
 * state block; anything else routes to loc_2bd3, still the frozen ORACLE record builder, which
 * rebuilds the target's four-byte sprite record. A wrong advance, cell, or route diverges the
 * resulting RAM. Declared LIVE-OUT is memory-only (the cell crosses the embed boundary as an
 * argument, not a register), so the diff is RAM-only.
 *
 * CRAFTED ENTRY. The attract demo never digs, so 0x2d06 is never dispatched and cannot be captured
 * directly. Per the crafted-entry method the gate seeds from a REAL captured attract state (cloned at
 * a routine that IS reached, loc_3dae) — a valid machine with real video RAM and a live stack — then
 * pokes only the inputs this routine reads: the target coordinates and the probed tile (stamped into
 * the exact cell the geometry lands on). The three axes that shape the output are then swept: the
 * whole tile domain (0..255, pinning the embed-vs-continue boundary), and the target's position
 * across both axes (0..255, pinning the row/column/advance arithmetic incl. the byte wraps).
 *
 * THE STACK SCRATCH. The still-oracle record-builder tail (loc_2bd3 → loc_2f71) and the embed path's
 * dig-sound enqueue save and restore register pairs on the stack, and the oracle leaves its
 * arithmetic in those registers while the stack-free idiomatic path does not — so a few dead bytes
 * just below the entry stack pointer differ (The Pit's stack is real diffed work RAM, ~0x83f7 here).
 * Classic dead scratch, restored before anything reads it. The diff excludes exactly that [SP-N, SP)
 * window and compares everything else byte-for-byte; every real output lives far below the stack
 * (0x80a9..0x80ac, 0x80af plus the sprite record at 0x8228 and video RAM), so the window can hide
 * none — the teeth confirm it. Registers/flags/pc/SP are excluded per the honest-signature contract.
 *
 * Checks:
 *   0. IDENTITY (harness) — oracle vs oracle on a crafted entry is EQUAL (capture/replay works and
 *      the whole still-oracle cascade is deterministic).
 *   1. EQUAL (tile sweep 0..255) — for every possible tile ahead, advanceDigTarget leaves the same
 *      state as the oracle; the sweep spans both the embed route (3 codes) and the continue route.
 *   2. EQUAL (position sweep, both axes) — sweeping the advanced axis and the row axis 0..255 with a
 *      passable tile, every advance/cell is identical, including the top-of-range byte wraps.
 *   3. NON-VACUOUS — a crafted entry actually advances TARGET_Y and writes the carve cursor (a no-op
 *      twin cannot pass), and agrees with the oracle on both routes.
 *   4. TEETH (advance) — a twin with the wrong advanced position is CAUGHT at TARGET_Y.
 *   5. TEETH (cursor) — a twin with the wrong carve cursor is CAUGHT at 0x80af.
 *   6. TEETH (route) — a twin that never embeds is CAUGHT on a solid-tile entry (the embed path's
 *      dig-sound request + state reset are all missing).
 *   7. TEETH (embed cell) — a twin that hands the embed continuation the wrong cell is CAUGHT in
 *      video RAM (the wall stamp lands in the wrong cell), proving the cell argument is exercised.
