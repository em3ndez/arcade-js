/**
 * Memory-equivalence gate for spawnPendingDigObject (ROM 0x2c04) — the routine that
 * dequeues a random queued column and spawns a dig object there.
 *
 * Its whole effect is memory: the spawn-active flag, the dig-object staging bytes, the
 * cleared queue slot, the target coordinates, the painted tilemap cell, and the
 * player-overlap flag. Declared live-out is MEMORY-ONLY, so the gate compares RAM, not
 * the value registers/flags the oracle leaves behind (the honest-signature contract).
 *
 * WHY A CRAFTED ENTRY. The dig-object spawn path is never dispatched in a plain attract
 * run (0x2c04 is not entered over thousands of frames), so the capture/replay harness
 * cannot hook it directly. Per the crafted-entry method the gate instead runs the routine
 * from a REAL captured attract machine, poked so the spawn has something to do: the
 * 24-slot column queue is cleared and specific slots filled, and the tracked-object
 * position is set to place the spawn on or off the player. Each shape forces one control
 * path — a left-only column (keeps the left slot), a right-only column (skips pairing), a
 * paired column (switches to the right slot), all-left / all-right fills, and the wrap
 * edge of the on-player window — and a broad randomized sweep covers the rest. The
 * generator is seeded so the retry loop lands on the intended slot deterministically.
 *
 * ONE WRINKLE — the oracle marshals its two helper calls (the spawn sound and the random
 * draw) through the Z80 stack, which is real diffed work RAM; each push leaves dead bytes
 * just below the entry stack pointer that the stack-free idiomatic JS does not reproduce.
 * Measured, they occupy a fixed 6-byte window; the RAM diff excludes [entrySP-16, entrySP)
 * to cover it with margin (isolated from every real output — the work-RAM cells sit well
 * below it and the tilemap well above) and compares everything else byte-for-byte. The
 * tail hand-off to the sprite-record builder is identical on both sides, so pc/SP line up
 * without a fixup and the diff stays RAM-only.
 *
 * Checks:
 *   0. HARNESS — capture a real attract entry, craft a spawnable state, and confirm the
 *      oracle run is deterministic (oracle vs oracle identical outside the stack window).
 *   1. EQUAL (deterministic shapes) — over each crafted control path the idiomatic
 *      routine leaves the same RAM as the oracle, and the spawn outputs (queue cleared,
 *      tile painted, coordinates, overlap flag) hold the hand-computed values.
 *   2. EQUAL (randomized sweep) — random generator seed + random queue + random object
 *      position; RAM identical to the oracle every time.
 *   3. TEETH (overlap flag) — a twin that flips the published player-overlap flag is CAUGHT.
 *   4. TEETH (target coordinate) — a twin that corrupts the spawn X coordinate is CAUGHT.
 *   5. TEETH (painted tile) — a twin that paints the wrong tile into the cell is CAUGHT.
