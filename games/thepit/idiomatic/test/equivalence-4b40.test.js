/**
 * Memory-equivalence gate for loc_4b40 (ROM 0x4b40) — the 0x90 board-mode door.
 *
 * loc_4b40 stows the board-mode / entry-select byte 0x90 at BOARD_MODE and rebuilds
 * the screen for that board: it clears sprite/attribute RAM, repaints the whole
 * tilemap, flat-fills colour RAM (using that byte as the screen-wide colour), and
 * wipes the sprite-record staging block. Its declared live-out is MEMORY-ONLY — every
 * byte those steps write, plus the return to the caller — so the gate compares RAM +
 * pc + SP and drops the value registers the oracle leaves behind (the honest-signature
 * contract).
 *
 * WHY A CRAFTED ENTRY. The 0x90 door is never dispatched during attract (the demo only
 * reaches the 0x00 and 0xC0 doors), so the capture/replay harness cannot hook 0x4b40
 * directly. Per the crafted-entry method the gate instead runs the routine from a REAL
 * captured sibling state: blankScreen (the 0x00 door) IS reached in attract and shares the
 * identical call convention and body, so its entry is a faithful state for the 0x90
 * door too. Crucially loc_4b40 never calls blankScreen, so cloning that entry introduces no
 * registry recursion. The one input that shapes the output — the board-mode byte — is
 * fixed 0x90 by the routine itself.
 *
 * ONE WRINKLE — the oracle runs its three setup steps as real subroutine calls, pushing
 * a return address onto the stack for each; The Pit's stack is real diffed work RAM
 * (0x83ff down). Those pushes leave two dead bytes just below the entry stack pointer
 * that the idiomatic composition does not reproduce (it makes its single net return
 * through the sprite/attribute-clear step and never parks an intermediate return there).
 * They are classic dead stack scratch — overwritten by the caller's next push before
 * anything reads them — so the RAM diff excludes exactly that [SP-2, SP) window and
 * compares everything else byte-for-byte. Both the oracle (via its closing tail-jump)
 * and the idiomatic routine model their own return, so no external ret is added.
 *
 * Five checks:
 *   0. HARNESS — capture a real blankScreen sibling entry and confirm the oracle run of
 *      loc_4b40 is deterministic (oracle vs oracle -> identical whole state + pc).
 *      Proves the capture/clone/diff plumbing reaches a genuine setup entry.
 *   1. EQUAL (crafted sibling entry) — loc_4b40 == oracle over RAM (outside the stack
 *      scratch) + pc + SP, and the setup actually landed: BOARD_MODE = 0x90, colour RAM
 *      all 0x90, tilemap all the fill code, sprite/attribute block and staging block
 *      zeroed.
 *   2. NON-VACUOUS — the same run proves EQUAL is not a no-op: BOARD_MODE goes
 *      0x00 -> 0x90 and the flat-filled colour RAM changes versus the captured entry.
 *   3. TEETH (wrong board mode) — a twin that stows 0x00 instead of 0x90 is CAUGHT at
 *      BOARD_MODE and in the colour RAM that byte flat-fills.
 *   4. TEETH (dropped tilemap fill) — a twin that skips the tilemap repaint is CAUGHT in
 *      the tilemap on a sentinel-seeded entry (proving a missed setup step surfaces).
 *
 * Run: node --test games/thepit/idiomatic/test/equivalence-4b40.test.js
