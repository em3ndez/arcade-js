/**
 * unpackLevelNibbleTables — expand the packed ROM level-geometry table into the working nibble tables.
 * ROM 0xc196.
 *
 * Role in the machine: each Tempest tube shape (the level's per-segment geometry) is stored packed in ROM
 * at loc_c1fd, two 4-bit fields per byte. Before a wave can render, the game must explode those bytes into
 * two eight-entry working tables of raw nibbles the geometry/render code reads directly, and mirror them
 * into color RAM so the display list picks them up. This is the unpack that wave setup (selectWaveStartSlot,
 * resetVectorTailCursor) runs on level (re)start.
 *
 * Behavior: read the level selector loc_9f, mask it to bits 6..4 (0x70) and clamp it to 0x5f so an
 * out-of-range level saturates to the last valid shape. Form the packed-table read index as (sel>>1)|0x07,
 * then walk y = 7..0, consuming one packed byte per step (x decremented alongside y). Each byte's low nibble
 * is written into geometry-low loc_19+y and its display mirror COLOR_RAM loc_800+y; its high nibble into
 * geometry-high loc_21+y and mirror loc_808+y.
 *
 * Live-out: the eight-entry low table loc_19..loc_20, the eight-entry high table loc_21..loc_28, and their
 * color-RAM mirrors at loc_800.. / loc_808.. — the working tube geometry consumed by the renderer.
 * Grounding: [seen].
