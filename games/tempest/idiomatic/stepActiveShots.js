/**
 * stepActiveShots — advance every active shot/object slot one tick down its lane. ROM 0xa18f.
 *
 * Role in the machine: the twelve object slots (0x0b..0) hold in-flight shots and the objects they become.
 * This routine ticks all of them each frame, split into two classes by index: the high slots (8..0x0b) are
 * fast objects whose depth is integrated from a 16-bit velocity, and the low slots (0..7) are lane shots
 * whose depth steps by a fixed increment and gets scored against enemies on the lane. Slots that run off the
 * end of the tube are retired and their live count decremented.
 *
 * Behavior: it seeds the loop index SLOT_LOOP_INDEX to 0x0b and counts down. A slot is skipped when its
 * SLOT_STATE,x (the high/depth byte) is 0 (inactive). For a high slot (x >= 8): add OBJECT_VELOCITY_LO into
 * the low position loc_2e6,x, carry into the new high = SLOT_STATE,x + OBJECT_VELOCITY_HI + carry. If that
 * high is still at/beyond the floor PLAYER_SHOT_DEPTH the object lives (store the new high); otherwise it has
 * fallen past the near edge — drop ACTIVE_ENEMY_COUNT, finalize via primeTopObjectOnTargetMatch, and clear
 * the slot. For a low slot (x < 8): step the counter SLOT_STATE,x by +9 (less 4 when HIT_TALLY,x is flagged),
 * store it, then advanceShotAndScoreLaneHit resolves the shot against the lane and returns the effective slot
 * index xEff (it may retarget). If SLOT_STATE,xEff has reached the far limit >= 0xf0, drop ACTIVE_OBJECT_COUNT
 * and clear that slot. The loop decrements SLOT_LOOP_INDEX and stops when it wraps negative (bit7 set).
 *
 * Live-out: updated SLOT_STATE / loc_2e6 position bytes for every live slot, cleared slots at the limits,
 * decremented ACTIVE_ENEMY_COUNT / ACTIVE_OBJECT_COUNT, SLOT_LOOP_INDEX left at 0xff, plus any scoring the
 * lane-hit and prime helpers apply. Grounding: [seen].
