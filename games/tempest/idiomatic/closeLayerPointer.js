/**
 * closeLayerPointer — close one draw layer: emit its header record, then patch the layer's base pointer to
 * whichever of two alternating buffers the toggled parity selects. ROM 0xb2fe.
 *
 * Role in the machine: Tempest renders the tube as vector display lists, one per layer/slot. Each layer is
 * double-buffered — it keeps an "even" and an "odd" draw buffer and alternates between them frame to frame
 * so the display can read one while the other is rebuilt. Closing a layer finalizes the record just built
 * (emitRecordBodyC0) and then repoints the layer's list target at the freshly toggled buffer, so the next
 * pass draws into the correct half.
 *
 * Behavior: takes the slot in the accumulator (a). It emits the header body, then forms idx = 2*slot (a<<1,
 * masked to a byte) to index the stride-2 pointer tables. It seats the working pointer loc_3b/loc_3c
 * (the ($3b) indirect) from the base-pointer table 0xce8c/0xce8d at idx. It toggles this slot's parity flag
 * at 0x415+slot (XOR 1) and stores it back. On parity set it selects the odd buffer word 0xceb0/0xceb1,
 * otherwise the even buffer word 0xce9e/0xce9f, both at idx. Finally it reads the seated ($3b) target as a
 * word (dst) and writes the chosen lo/hi pair into dst and dst+1.
 *
 * Live-out: loc_3b/loc_3c hold the base-pointer word for this slot; the parity flag 0x415+slot is toggled;
 * and the two bytes at the ($3b) target are overwritten with the selected buffer pointer. Grounding: [seen].
