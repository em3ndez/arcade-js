/**
 * seedPerLaneSpikeArray — init-time seeder for the per-lane spike/limit block. ROM 0x9234.
 *
 * Role in the machine: when a wave is armed the spawner needs a fresh per-lane control
 * block — one header cell that counts how many entries are live plus a parallel run of
 * sixteen per-lane cells (one for each tube lane) that gate how far up a lane an enemy may
 * climb. This routine lays that block down from the level's initialization constants so the
 * wave starts from a known state. It is one link in the wave spawn chain driven off the
 * spawn cadence (unpackLevelNibbleTables → reseedStateTables → seedPerLaneSpikeArray → …).
 *
 * Behavior: copy the header source byte $15b into the header cell $3ab (the live/active
 * count the rest of the spawn path reads), then read the fill constant from $15a once and
 * write it into all sixteen body cells $3ac..$3ac+0x0f, counting X down from 0x0f to 0.
 *
 * Live-out: $3ab (header / active count) and the sixteen per-lane cells $3ac..$3bb, all
 * seeded for the wave the spawner is about to build. Grounding: [seen].
