/**
 * spawnEntityIntoFreeSlot — conditionally spawn an entity at the player's position. ROM 0xa23f.
 *
 * Role in the machine: this decides whether to drop a new entity (an enemy/shot object seeded at the
 * player's current tube position) and, if so, seats it in a free object slot. The go/no-go decision is
 * a "gate": in one mode it is a debounced input bit, in the other it is a crowding count of how many
 * flyers already sit near the player's segment plus a spike-active bias. Only when the gate is nonzero
 * does it allocate a slot, copy the player's depth/segment/angle into it, and fire the spawn sound and
 * proximity-interaction helpers.
 *
 * Behavior: bails immediately if PLAYER_FINE_ANGLE (loc_201) bit7 is set (player not spawnable). It then
 * forms the gate. If STATUS_FLAGS (loc_5) is negative, the gate is simply INPUT_DEBOUNCED & 0x10
 * (loc_4d, a fire/hold bit). Otherwise it seeds loc_29 from SPIKE_ACTIVE_FLAG (loc_106) and, for each
 * flyer slot x = 10..0 that is occupied (loc_2db,x nonzero), takes the absolute segment distance between
 * that flyer's segment loc_2b5,x and PLAYER_SEGMENT (loc_200); every flyer within 1 segment increments
 * loc_29. The resulting loc_29 is the gate. A zero gate bails (nothing to spawn against). Otherwise it
 * scans the object slot table SLOT_STATE (loc_2d3, x = 7..0) for the first free (zero) entry, bumps the
 * live-object count ACTIVE_OBJECT_COUNT (loc_135), and seeds that slot: state = PLAYER_SHOT_DEPTH
 * (loc_202), TARGET_SEG = PLAYER_SEGMENT (loc_200), loc_2c0 = PLAYER_FINE_ANGLE (loc_201), HIT_TALLY = 0.
 * It then calls requestEnemySpawnSound and resolveSlotProximityInteractions for that slot and stops —
 * only the first free slot is filled.
 *
 * Live-out: on a spawn, the seeded slot across SLOT_STATE/TARGET_SEG/loc_2c0/HIT_TALLY, the bumped
 * ACTIVE_OBJECT_COUNT, and the queued spawn sound / proximity resolution; loc_29 holds the computed
 * gate count. Grounding: [seen].
