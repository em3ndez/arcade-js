/**
 * armModeAndRebuildIfEnabled — arm the dispatch mode, then rebuild control blocks if conditions allow.
 * ROM 0xd7e1.
 *
 * Role in the machine: this is a mode-transition gate. It unconditionally arms two mode selectors, then
 * decides — from the EAROM busy flag, an operator/enable input, and a pending-work request — whether to
 * regenerate the game's control blocks from their template. The rebuild is expensive and must only run
 * when the machine is idle, the feature is enabled, and there is actually pending work to service.
 *
 * Behavior: clear the status/flags byte $5 (STATUS_FLAGS) and set the dispatch selector $1 to 0x02
 * (MODE_DISPATCH_SEL). Then bail early on any guard: if $1ca (EAROM_MODE) is nonzero the EAROM is busy, so
 * return; if bit 4 of the option port $c00 (IN0_PORT) is clear the feature is disabled, so return.
 * Otherwise write $0 = 0x00 (GAME_MODE, idle) and check the pending-work word $1c9 (PENDING_WORK_FLAGS):
 * only when its low two bits show a queued request does it call rebuildControlBlocksFromTemplate.
 *
 * Live-out: $5 = 0, $1 = 0x02, and (when it does not bail) $0 = 0x00; on the full path the control blocks
 * are rebuilt. Grounding: [seen].
