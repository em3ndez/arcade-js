/**
 * dispatchListSetupByColumn -- route to the coordinate-list setup entry for a given column. ROM 0x9a87.
 *
 * Role in the machine: when placeSpawnListForColumnDeficit tops up per-column enemy quotas, each column that
 * still owes enemies needs a spawn coordinate-list placed for it. This thin router takes the column number
 * in X and enters the shared list-setup computed jump so the right per-column setup entry runs.
 *
 * Behavior: copy X into the dispatch index and enter dispatchCoordListSetup, which routes by that value to
 * one of five coordinate-list setup entries. The selected entry's result tail-returns to this routine's own
 * caller (placeSpawnListForColumnDeficit).
 *
 * Live-out: whatever coordinate-list pointers/state the selected setup entry seats. Grounding: [seen].
