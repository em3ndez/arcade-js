/**
 * advanceShotAndScoreLaneHit — resolve a player shot's arrival on its lane target. ROM 0xa1fa
 * (score a lane hit).
 *
 * Role in the machine: Tempest fires shots down the tube's lanes at the enemies and flippers crawling
 * up them. Each active shot slot x tracks how far its shot has travelled toward the target that sits in
 * the lane it was launched into; stepActiveShots (0xa18f) drives that counter forward every frame and,
 * for the near slots (<8), calls here to ask "has the shot reached its mark yet, and if so what does the
 * hit do?". This routine is the scoring/kill body for one such slot: it compares the shot's progress
 * against the per-lane target depth and, when the shot lands, registers the hit — sound, target flag,
 * tally, and points — and, on a shot's second landing, spends it and drops it from the live object count.
 *
 * Behaviour: the slot's target segment y comes from TARGET_SEG,x (loc_2ad,x); the lane's remaining
 * target depth is LANE_LIMIT,y (loc_3ac,y). A zero depth means nothing is there to hit, so it returns x
 * untouched. Otherwise it reads the shot's travel counter SLOT_STATE,x (loc_2d3,x): once that counter
 * has reached the depth, the shot has arrived — it shrinks/clears the lane depth (writing the counter
 * back unless it has already saturated at >=0xf0, in which case it clears to 0), bumps this slot's hit
 * tally HIT_TALLY,x (loc_2f2,x), stamps the target-hit flag LANE_TARGET_FLAG,y = 0xc0 (loc_39a,y),
 * chimes via requestSegmentHitSound, primes the three award scratch cells (loc_2a/loc_2b = 0, loc_29 =
 * 1), and awards points with addBcdScoreAndAwardAtThreshold. It then reloads the working index from the
 * shared slot-loop index SLOT_LOOP_INDEX, since the award path may have re-entered the slot loop. Finally,
 * whichever index is now live, if its hit tally has reached two the shot is spent: clear its travel
 * counter SLOT_STATE and decrement the active object count ACTIVE_OBJECT_COUNT.
 *
 * Live-out: LANE_LIMIT,y (shrunk/cleared), HIT_TALLY,x (bumped), LANE_TARGET_FLAG,y (=0xc0), the award
 * scratch loc_29/loc_2a/loc_2b, SLOT_STATE (cleared on a spent shot), ACTIVE_OBJECT_COUNT (decremented
 * on a spent shot), plus the score and any sound queued by the callees. Returns the slot index live at
 * exit (the reloaded SLOT_LOOP_INDEX when a hit fired, else the entry x) so the caller resumes on the
 * right slot. Grounding: [code].
