/**
 * requestScoreAwardSound — cue the score/bonus award sound. ROM 0xccb9.
 *
 * Role in the machine: a one-line named cue that fires Tempest's score-award voice.
 * Sound id 0x4f is the award chime; the bonus/level-advance handler chain (loc_c98c)
 * fires it as the player clears a wave, and the BCD score-add path (loc_ca6c) fires the
 * same id when a threshold award lands — so this is the "you scored / bonus" sound.
 *
 * Behavior: hand the fixed sound id 0x4f to the shared enable gate requestSoundIfEnabled,
 * which only actually voices it when the global sound-enable flag is set (loc_5 bit 7).
 * No cells of its own; all state lives downstream in the loader.
 *
 * Live-out: none directly — the effect is a queued sound-voice slot inside the gate/loader.
 * Grounding: [seen].
