/**
 * commitPendingModeAfterDelay — run down the mode-change delay and commit the pending mode. ROM 0xc800.
 *
 * Role in the machine: Tempest holds the game in a top-level mode cell ($00 GAME_MODE) — attract, play,
 * end-of-level, high-score entry, and so on. When something requests a mode change it does not switch
 * immediately; it stashes the target in GAME_MODE_PENDING ($02) and arms a short countdown so the current
 * screen lingers for a beat. This routine, called every frame, is what actually retires that countdown and
 * flips the live mode over once the delay expires. It runs on the spinner-service path, so no matter which
 * branch it takes it finishes by updating the player's blaster position around the rim of the tube.
 *
 * Behavior: first the guard test — while the frame-counter bit selected by MODE_DELAY_GUARD ($16b) reads
 * back set (loc_3 & loc_16b), the countdown is suppressed and it does nothing but delegate the spinner.
 * Otherwise it decrements the delay timer ($04) toward zero (clamped, never underflowing past 0). On the
 * exact frame the timer reaches zero it copies the pending mode into the live GAME_MODE cell and clears the
 * guard ($16b := 0) so the arming is spent. Every path tail-calls rotateBlasterAroundRim to move the shooter.
 *
 * Live-out: MODE_DELAY_TIMER ($04) decremented; on expiry GAME_MODE ($00) := GAME_MODE_PENDING ($02) and
 * MODE_DELAY_GUARD ($16b) := 0. Returns the spinner update's result. Grounding: [seen].
