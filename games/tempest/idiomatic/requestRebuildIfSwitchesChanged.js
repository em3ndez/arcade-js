/**
 * requestRebuildIfSwitchesChanged — request a control-block rebuild when the DIP/option
 * switches have moved since last cached. ROM 0xac20.
 *
 * Role in the machine: the operator DIP switches select difficulty, coinage, lives, etc.
 * Those settings feed the control blocks the game builds each round. This routine detects a
 * change in the decoded switch state and, only on a change, raises the pending-rebuild
 * request bits so the control-block rebuilder (loc_abac) regenerates from the template. On
 * no change it takes a shared no-op tail and leaves everything alone.
 *
 * Behavior: first re-decode the live option/switch snapshot (decodeOptionSwitches refreshes
 * the DSW2 and difficulty snapshot cells). Then compare two masked fields against their
 * cached targets: (DSW2_SNAPSHOT & 0xf8) vs INPUT_SNAPSHOT_HI, and (DSW_DIFFICULTY & 0x03)
 * vs INPUT_SNAPSHOT_LO. If both match, the switches are unchanged — take switchesUnchangedReturn
 * (does nothing, returns). If either differs, call raiseRebuildRequestBits to set the
 * pending-rebuild request bits, which the rebuilder later consumes and re-latches these
 * same cached targets from.
 *
 * Live-out: on a mismatch, the pending-rebuild request bits raised by raiseRebuildRequestBits;
 * the snapshot cells refreshed by decodeOptionSwitches either way. Grounding: [seen].
