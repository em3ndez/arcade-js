/**
 * stepEnemyFleetAndSpawn — drive one frame of the enemy bank. ROM 0xa618.
 *
 * Role in the machine: once per frame this walks the 16 enemy slots, moving every active enemy and
 * refilling empty slots with fresh spawns as long as the per-wave spawn budget still has entries. It is
 * the top of the enemy update: the slot walk here calls the motion steps and the spawner, and its exit
 * decides when the wave has emptied (no enemies live, none spawned) and asks the mode machine to move on.
 *
 * Behavior: seed the frame-active flag SPAWN_FOUND_FLAG from the spawn budget SPAWN_BUDGET_TIMER, then
 * walk slots 0x0f..0. A live slot (ENEMY_SLOT_FLAGS,x != 0) integrates its free-flight position and then
 * decays its velocity, and marks the frame active (SPAWN_FOUND_FLAG = 0xff). A free slot spawns a new
 * enemy while the budget is nonzero. The register y threads the last live slot's decay return forward:
 * spawnEnemyInSlot stamps it into the new enemy, so the last-stepped axis carries into each later spawn.
 * After the walk SLOT_LOOP_INDEX settles at 0xff; on even frames (FRAME_COUNTER bit0 clear) the budget
 * ticks one toward zero; and if nothing was live or spawned, GAME_MODE is raised to the mode-request 0x12.
 *
 * Live-out: the stepped enemy slots, SPAWN_BUDGET_TIMER (decremented on even frames), SLOT_LOOP_INDEX
 * = 0xff, and GAME_MODE = 0x12 when the bank came up empty. Grounding: [seen].
