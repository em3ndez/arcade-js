/**
 * scanAllSlotsForProximity -- drive the proximity pass across the whole live set. ROM 0xa454.
 *
 * Role in the machine: Tempest tracks up to eight active objects in the eight-entry slot table at
 * $2d3 (SLOT_STATE). Each frame the game must let every occupied slot react to how near it now sits
 * to the other objects sharing its web lane -- that is what decides whether an enemy is close enough
 * to be caught, to spawn, or to be torn down. This routine is the outer loop that visits all eight
 * slots and hands each live one to the per-slot proximity resolver.
 *
 * Behavior: walk the slot index x from 7 down to 0. Read the slot's state byte from $2d3,x; a zero
 * entry is a dead/unused slot and is skipped. For every nonzero entry, call
 * resolveSlotProximityInteractions with that entry value as the proximity threshold and x as the slot
 * index, letting it fold that slot against the coordinate set and retire/spawn as its rules dictate.
 *
 * Live-out: nothing of its own -- all state changes ($2d3,x teardown, live count $135, spawns) happen
 * inside resolveSlotProximityInteractions per visited slot. Grounding: [seen].
