 * requestLevelIntroSound — voice the level-intro / skill-step start. ROM 0xccfe.
 *
 * Role in the machine: a one-line cue that requests fixed sound id 0xbf through the enable
 * gate requestSoundIfEnabled (loc_ccc3). Its sole caller (loc_90c4) fires it at phase 3 of
 * the start-slot pick / wave working-set reseed, so this is the sound heard as a new level's
 * intro / the skill-rate start step begins.
 *
 * Behavior: request the constant id 0xbf through the gate (no slot index threaded). Live-out:
 * a queued sound request when the loc_5 enable flag permits it (dropped otherwise).
 * Grounding: [seen].
