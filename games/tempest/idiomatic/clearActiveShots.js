/**
 * clearActiveShots — reset the shot bank to its baseline. ROM 0x928f.
 *
 * Role in the machine: a reset leaf called at wave start and on collisions to wipe the active-shot
 * state. It zeroes the 12-entry per-slot state array and both running count cells so the shot/object
 * bookkeeping starts clean.
 *
 * Behavior: it walks SLOT_STATE from index 0x0b down to 0, storing 0x00 into each of the 12 cells, then
 * clears ACTIVE_OBJECT_COUNT and ACTIVE_ENEMY_COUNT to 0x00.
 *
 * Live-out: the 12-byte SLOT_STATE array and the two count cells, all zeroed. Grounding: [seen].
