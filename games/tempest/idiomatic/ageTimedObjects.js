/**
 * ageTimedObjects -- age the timed-object animation table one tick. ROM 0xa416.
 *
 * Role in the machine: Tempest keeps up to 8 short-lived animated objects (the transient
 * shapes -- pulsars/explosions/superzapper flashes and the like) in a slot table. Each frame
 * this routine ticks every live slot's animation counter forward by that object's per-type
 * step; a slot whose counter reaches its per-type limit has finished its animation and is
 * freed. The single pending flag TIMED_OBJECT_COUNT both gates the whole pass (skip it when
 * nothing is animating) and is rebuilt as a live-slot count so the next frame knows whether
 * to run again.
 *
 * Behavior: if TIMED_OBJECT_COUNT is 0 there is nothing pending -- return. Otherwise zero it,
 * then walk slots 7..0. Skip empty slots (SHAPE_ACTIVE+i == 0). For a live slot read its type
 * (SHAPE_ID+i), add the per-type step TIMED_OBJ_STEP_TABLE[type] to its animation counter
 * SHAPE_ANIM+i (8-bit wrap), and compare: still below the per-type limit
 * TIMED_OBJ_LIMIT_TABLE[type] means the object is still animating, so re-raise
 * TIMED_OBJECT_COUNT; at or past the limit the object is done, so free the slot
 * (SHAPE_ACTIVE+i = 0).
 *
 * Live-out: the SHAPE_ANIM counters (advanced), freed SHAPE_ACTIVE slots, and TIMED_OBJECT_COUNT
 * rebuilt as the count of slots still animating (0 => no more work next frame).
 *
 * Grounding: [seen].
