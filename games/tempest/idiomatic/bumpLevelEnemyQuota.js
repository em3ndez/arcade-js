/**
 * bumpLevelEnemyQuota — ramp the per-level enemy quota, then start the wave. ROM 0xc98c.
 *
 * Role in the machine: as the player clears waves, Tempest slowly raises how many enemies a level
 * spawns. This routine bumps that quota for the current level, flips the game into the wave-active
 * mode, optionally runs a score-award chain, and tail-delegates into the wave initializer.
 *
 * Behavior: it reads the current level index loc_3d and forms the PLAYER_LEVEL_TBL slot for it. While
 * that slot's quota is below the 0x62 cap it increments both the slot and the working copy loc_9f
 * together (they track in lockstep). It then seeds GAME_MODE=0x18 (wave active). If the parallel
 * loc_102 slot for this level is nonzero it uses that value as a trigger: seat it as an in-page pointer
 * (seatInPagePointer), add it to the BCD score awarding at the 0xff threshold, and request the
 * score-award sound. Finally it tail-delegates to runWaveInit to bring the wave up.
 *
 * Live-out: the bumped PLAYER_LEVEL_TBL slot and loc_9f, GAME_MODE=0x18, any score/sound side effects
 * from the trigger chain, and whatever runWaveInit leaves. Grounding: [seen].
