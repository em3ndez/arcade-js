/**
 * resetBothPokeyChips — dual-POKEY sound-chip reset and RNG seed. ROM 0xcd95.
 *
 * Role in the machine: Tempest carries two POKEY chips ($60c0 and $60d0) that generate all of its
 * audio. This is the one-time board-init pass (called from runMainFrameLoop's startup and again from
 * the level-timer reset setupLevelTimers) that puts both chips into a known-quiet state and, as a
 * side errand, harvests a hardware random seed. Bringing the serial-control register (SKCTL) low then
 * back to 7 is the documented POKEY initialization handshake — it also frees the polynomial noise
 * generators to run, which is what makes the RANDOM register produce fresh values.
 *
 * Behavior: first it forces both SKCTL latches to 0 (chips held in reset) and clears the scratch flag
 * $720. It snapshots both RANDOM registers, then polls up to five times; the moment either register
 * has moved off its snapshot it latches the first chip's snapshot value into $720 as a seed and stops.
 * It then writes 7 to both SKCTL latches to release the chips, walks the eight audio registers of each
 * chip ($60c0..7 and $60d0..7) to silence, zeroes the paired eight-entry software mirror arrays
 * ($c0,x = voice value and $d0,x = voice level) that the sound engine tracks in RAM, and finally
 * clears both AUDCTL control registers ($60c8/$60d8).
 *
 * Live-out: both POKEY chips silenced and armed (SKCTL=7, all AUDF/AUDCTL clear), the two 8-byte
 * software sound arrays $c0/$d0 cleared, and the RNG seed cell $720 (either the harvested sample or 0
 * if neither counter moved during the five polls). Grounding: [seen].
