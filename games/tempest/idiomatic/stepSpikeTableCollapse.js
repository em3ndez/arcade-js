/**
 * stepSpikeTableCollapse — collapse the descending-spike height table one step. ROM 0xa7d2.
 *
 * Role in the machine: Tempest's Spikers crawl up a lane leaving a spike behind them; a separate
 * descending-spike object animates those spikes shrinking back down. loc_3fe is the 8-entry table of
 * per-lane spike heights and SPIKE_TABLE_GUARD ($0115) is that object's arm/guard flag. This routine
 * advances the whole table one frame toward flat: tall spikes lose a fixed amount of height, short ones
 * are pushed to one of two rails, and once the whole table has drained to zero the object disarms itself.
 * The guard's sign bit selects which rail (0xf0 vs 0) the snap uses, so the same table can be driven up or
 * down by flipping one flag.
 *
 * Behavior: no-op while the guard is zero (object not armed). Otherwise walk the eight slots from x=7 down
 * to 0. A tall entry (>= 0x17) shrinks by 7. A smaller nonzero entry snaps to the guard-signed rail
 * (0xf0 when the guard is negative, else 0). A zero entry stays 0 unless the guard is negative, in which
 * case it may adopt 0xf0 by borrowing from its wrap-around next neighbour (only when that neighbour is
 * nonzero and below 0xd5). Every result is OR-folded into acc so the loop learns whether anything remains.
 *
 * Live-out: the rewritten loc_3fe height table; loc_29 ($0029) holds the OR-fold of all results;
 * SLOT_LOOP_INDEX ($0037) is reset to 0xff for the next per-slot walk; and SPIKE_TABLE_GUARD is cleared
 * to 0 (disarming the object) once the table has fully collapsed. Grounding: [seen].
