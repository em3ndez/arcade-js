# tempest — §5 adversarial done-audit (DONE)

**Verdict: DONE — zero open criteria.**

- **Audited commit:** `0599e3e0e76cc899230374e13c6e2ff36f09a57c`
  (`tempest: free-run idiomatic-vs-oracle display equivalence gate`) == **HEAD == `origin/main`** (the audited
  substantive game state is on origin; this done-marker commit adds this `DONE.md` on top). Tempest is
  arcade-js's SECOND 6502 port and its FIRST vector (QuadraScan) game.
- **Auditor (proposer):** a FRESH, independent, adversarial §5 done-auditor — Claude Opus 4.8 (Claude Code
  agent), dispatched by Jimmy-arcade2, **NOT** involved in building the port. Every criterion below was
  re-derived by RUNNING the command and READING the source at this commit — never "the gates are green," never
  a read of the prior `DONE.md`. Proposer≠confirmer: committing this file triggers `review_gate`, whose
  reviewer is a SECOND independent adversarial agent (reviewer-rules **R40**) that re-runs the FULL §5 audit
  against the game state at that commit — **not** a read of this file — and clears the commit only on
  independent agreement.
- **Why this re-audit exists (display-bug history):** the prior `DONE.md` (audited `04fc8d62`) declared DONE
  but was BLIND to a real display bug — `emitEnemySlotEntry` (idiomatic port of ROM 0xc6c7) built a
  2-byte-short display-list record in its target-flag bit6 branch (it discarded the advanced offset returned by
  `appendNormalizedMantissaExponent`), shifting every later enemy record and drawing a stray green vector in
  ~1% of attract frames. It passed EVERY gate because the per-routine equivalence tests and the pixel gate PIN
  the POKEY `RANDOM` LFSR to MAME's captured sequence — they only ever visit MAME's states, and the bug
  diverged only in FREE-RUN (unpinned) states the shipped clock-free RNG reaches. **Fixed** in `e6392c89` (the
  bit6 branch now consumes `appendNormalizedMantissaExponent(m)`'s returned Y for a full 4-byte record).
  **Gated** in `0599e3e0` (this commit) by a new standing class-level check,
  `games/tempest/test/freerun-equivalence.test.js`, which runs the idiomatic layer FREE-RUN over the full
  attract and asserts its display list equals the frozen oracle's every frame — the free-run correctness check
  the prior audit lacked.

- **ROM sha256 (all four manifest parts, `games/tempest/manifest.js` images):**
  - **maincpu** (parts `136002-133.d1 136002-134.f1 136002-235.j1 136002-136.lm1 136002-237.p1`, five program
    ROMs concatenated to 0x5000; machine.js maps them at 0x9000 and reloads the last 4K at 0xF000 per MAME's
    `ROM_RELOAD`):
    `3697ff0d18a8d3114e4cc023b2af76a7054712b1cb7536628c56838a2a0d3399`
  - **vectorrom** (part `136002-138.np3`, 0x1000, the vector display-list ROM at 0x3000):
    `c9d7fc0469085d04682dfba3f6f3730bfd818d613207fbf211b3232eb23fb321`
  - **avgprom** (part `136002-125.d7`, 0x100, the AVG state PROM):
    `45fdce76e631695940da6a1d94517177403591046e83bbabdbb72c674906d361`
  - **mathbox_user2** (part `136002.126`, 0x20):
    `14efb14ac87a8db219fb998e4ce14fa62488f1c9cfd882b41b9eb09efffee373`

  All four re-derived fresh with `shasum -a 256 games/tempest/rom/*.bin` and each is byte-identical to its
  `manifest.js` `sha256`. Tempest's audio is **two POKEYs driven straight off the 6502** (no sound CPU, no
  sample ROM), so there is no external sound disassembly; the mathbox `user3` nibble-interleaved ROM is not
  assembled (the mathbox is unimplemented — the guest math runs in the lifted 6502 code paths, off any
  reachable live path).

## Per-§5-criterion verdict table (fresh command outputs)

| Criterion | Verdict | Concrete evidence (re-run at HEAD `0599e3e0`) |
|---|---|---|
| **§3 completeness** (the biggest trap) | PASS | **Re-derived statically AND by execution, with a source-verified positive control.** (a) `python3 tools/idiomatic_gate.py worklist tempest` → `tempest: total 0  [registers=0 calls=0 pushes=0 addrs=0 mem=0 masks=0 stack=0 unlifted=0]` — **no reachable routine is served by the translated oracle**. (b) The layer is `idiomaticComplete` with **call=0 / addr=0 / push=0**, so every routine-to-routine call is a **statically-resolved JS import** and the computed-jump dispatchers index static tables of imported functions; a missing routine is therefore a **module-load failure**, not a deep-state runtime surprise — and the module loads (browser-boot + all suites pass). (c) By execution: `pixel_suite.py --done` runs the live idiomatic layer clean over the attract golden (**400 content frames**) and the coin/start/fire gameplay golden (**356 content frames**) with **no boot-gap stop**; `transition.test.js` drives attract→play→**game-over** (a deep state) clean. **Positive control (verified at source):** `games/tempest/machine.js:126` throws `NotImplemented("m.call: no routine registered at 0x…")` for any unregistered dispatch target; `games/tempest/tools/pixel_suite.mjs:114` `process.exit(1)`s on **any non-`PIN_DRAINED` stop** (a real boot gap) and `:118` on a frozen render. A gap in a deep state would bite; none exists. |
| **done_gate** | PASS | `python3 tools/done_gate.py check --game tempest` → **all 9 subsystems `[OK]`** (idiomatic, wiring, grounding, naming, comments, audio, pixel, whole-game, browser), exit **0**. (The full run needs ~8 min because its `pixel` subsystem crawls the full `--done` golden; a green pre-filter is necessary, never sufficient — the audit below re-derives each line independently.) |
| **idiomatic** | PASS | `idiomatic_gate.py check` → `tempest: 0 cruft (budget 25)  [regi=0 call=0 push=0 addr=0 mem=0 mask=0 stack=0 unlifted=0]  <- IDIOMATIC  [idiomaticComplete]`. Zero 6502 primitives, zero `m.call`, zero `m.push*`, zero raw addresses, zero register refs, zero unlifted routines — the idiomatic layer fully REPLACES the frozen oracle. |
| **wiring** | PASS | `node --test tools/test/registry-coverage.test.js tools/test/no-stale-mcall.test.js` → **24 pass, 0 fail**; `node --test tools/test/no-frozen-twin-call.test.js` → **14 pass, 0 fail**. Tempest has **NO entry in `tools/registry-coverage.config.mjs`** (neither `UNWIRED` nor `DEBT`) — the strongest form: *every* idiomatic module is DISPATCHED with no exemption. No `m.call` into a still-translated layer; no import+call of a frozen twin. |
| **grounding** | PASS | `done_gate` grounding line → **"fully grounded (17 accounted-for via grounding-debt.txt)"**; `grounding-debt.txt` holds exactly **17** `0x…` entries. **Three spot-checked genuinely irreducible-on-a-good-ROM at source:** **0xb955** (`returnConstantTwo`) — called at `drawMovingObjectSlots.js:84` **inside `if (active !== 0)`** (line 73), the active-object-slot draw arm never taken in deep-play/self-test/full-cycle capture. **0x051e** (`SORT_PAYLOAD_LO`) — written at `buildSortedSoundRequest.js:89-90`, gated by `if (!ordered)` (line 84) **and** `if (y >= 0xe8)` (line 87): a ≥2-row high-region bubble-swap only boot-clear ever hit. **0xd8ca** (`playPowerOnTone`) — the whole power-on-tone cluster (d8ca/d8cd/d92f/d931) is a **closed call-graph**: nothing imports `playPowerOnTone`, and `runPowerOnToneBursts` is imported only by `foldToneTableByte`/`seedToneBurstCount`, themselves the RAM-march self-test fault arms — reachable only on a RAM readback mismatch (a dead error arm on a good image). The remaining debt (RAM-fault tone d8cd/d92f/d931, EAROM region-erase dde9/dded, the `loc_ccc7` code-fetch bytes cccb–ccce misclassified as data, the SORT sibling cells 051f/0520/061e/061f/0620) is the same caller-reached-but-branch-never-taken / dead-error-arm class. |
| **naming** | PASS | `naming_gate.py check --game tempest` → "OK (no grounded routine left as loc_)". No `names-debt.txt` needed (absent). |
| **comments** | PASS | `comment_gate.py floor --game tempest` → "OK (every idiomatic file carries >= code // 2 + 3 comments)". `mechanisms.md` present (**627 lines**), narrated subsystem-by-subsystem against the final idiomatic code. |
| **audio** | PASS | `audio_gate.py check --game tempest` → OK (`model=synth`; map + map/wiring tests + per-voice null-mutant + no self-documented simplification). Model is honestly a **SYNTH** (two POKEYs off the 6502), served by `audio/synth.js`. The oracle is the **per-voice NULL-MUTANT** the runbook requires: `node --test games/tempest/test/synth-voices.test.js` → **14 pass, 0 fail**, driving each of the **8 voices** (4 channels × 2 chips) alone and asserting the mix is non-silent, plus idle-silent and volume-0 controls. |
| **pixel** (DUAL completeness+correctness) | PASS | `python3 games/tempest/tools/pixel_suite.py --done --rompath ~/Downloads` → **`pixel_suite: PASS`** (re-run fresh). **PART A (attract):** content=400, byte-exact **239 (59.8%)**, within-1%-band **397 (99.3%)**, longest-above-band-run 2; **R/B-swap NULL-MUTANT → byte-exact=0, within-band=0 → FAIL (teeth bite)**. **PART B (gameplay tape coin/start/fire):** content=356, byte-exact **70 (19.7%)**, within-1%-band **351 (98.6%)**, run 2; **null-mutant → 0 → FAIL (teeth bite)**. **PART C** state-validated (residue 1). **These byte-exact fractions are UNCHANGED by the display-bug fix** — because this gate pins `RANDOM` to MAME's sequence, it never visited the free-run states where the bug lived; its blindness is precisely why the freerun-equivalence gate (below) was added. The AVG→raster pipeline is independently **byte-exact** vs MAME: `python3 games/tempest/tools/vector_gate.py` → `vector_gate: PASS`, content frames **439**, byte-exact **285 (64.9%)** ≥ the 60% floor (non-exact frames are vector RAM sampled mid-AVG-walk — a harness async-sampling limit; complete display lists render byte-for-byte). |
| **free-run idiomatic-vs-oracle display equivalence** (NEW class-level teeth) | PASS | `node --test games/tempest/test/freerun-equivalence.test.js` → **2 pass, 0 fail**, exit **0**: `free-run equivalence: 900 attract frames, idiomatic == oracle`. Runs the idiomatic layer CLOCK-FREE (unpinned) over a full attract cycle and, each frame, rebuilds the oracle's display list from the SAME entry state and SAME `RANDOM` values the idiomatic frame consumed, then asserts the RENDER INPUTS (vectorRAM + colorRAM + beam flips) are byte-equal, pixel-confirmed on any mismatch. **Teeth (verified by reading the test):** at frame **130** it XORs 64 bytes of the active (rendered) display-list span and asserts BOTH the render-input diff AND the pixel diff catch it, with a clean-frame positive control first (line 144). This is the free-run correctness check the prior audit lacked — it closes the exact blind spot that hid the `emitEnemySlotEntry` short-record bug. |
| **whole-game (input-tape replay + forced transitions)** | PASS | `node --test games/tempest/test/*.test.js` → **39 tests, 39 pass, 0 fail** (now INCLUDING the freerun-equivalence gate): the coin/start/play tape drives **real gameplay** (into-play + spinner + fire all respond) with input null-mutants (drop coin/start/spinner/fire → the game does NOT progress/rotate/fire), the forced attract→play→game-over arc, the settled game-over screen content (display list rebuilt distinct from play + score triplet intact), and the audio suite. Not attract-only. |
| **idiomatic equivalence** | PASS | `node --test games/tempest/idiomatic/test/*.test.js` → **1297 tests, 1297 pass, 0 fail** (one more than the prior audit — the strengthened `equivalence-c6c7.test.js` adds a CRAFTED **target-flag bit6-SET** case that exercises the branch that hid the stale-cursor bug and asserts the record is a 4-byte append, with a 3-pair short-record mutant that diverges). Every idiomatic routine equals the frozen oracle in RAM on real dispatches, with CRAFTED cases and mutation TEETH. |
| **browser** | PASS | `node --test web/test/games-boot.test.js` → **9 pass, 0 skipped**; `tempest: boots the way the web worker constructs it`. Registered in `games/registry.js:4` (`GAMES` array). `games/tempest/screenshot.png` present (34 KB). ROT270 is baked into the vector transform (confirmed by `vector_gate` matching MAME's 480×640 ROT270 AVI byte-exact); the worker reads `convergence.idiomatic.irq` (an IRQ game, no vblank NMI). Live spinner FEEL + canvas are human-confirm-only per runbook §5 (node cannot drive pointer/canvas) — expected, not a gap. |
| **external disasm** | N/A | Tempest's sound is two POKEYs driven straight off the 6502 — no sound CPU, no sample ROM — so there is no external sound disassembly. No `games/tempest/contrib/` exists (confirmed absent); a Computer-Archaeology disassembly for Tempest is a SEPARATE deliverable, not in scope for this port DONE. |
| **ROM sha256** | PASS | All four on-disk digests (`shasum -a 256 games/tempest/rom/*.bin`) re-derived fresh and byte-identical to their `manifest.js` `sha256` (values above). |

## Named residues — each honest, bounded, re-verified, and not a blocker

1. **Clock-free forced-transition PIXEL residue (PART C).** The idiomatic layer is CLOCK-FREE and reads the
   POKEY `RANDOM` register (a hardware LFSR, no seed to freeze) at a slightly higher per-frame rate than MAME,
   so the record/replay entropy pin drains before the ~16–30s game-over; past the pin the RNG-driven STATE
   (enemy positions, score) forks, so the forced-transition PIXELS differ by STATE, not by rendering — the
   runbook's explicitly-permitted clock-free hazard, not a rendering defect. It is therefore **STATE-validated**
   instead of pixel-compared: `transition.test.js` asserts BOTH the attract→play→game-over arc AND the settled
   game-over screen content (display list rebuilt distinct-from-play + score triplet intact), with a coin-drop
   null-mutant tooth. Every rendering PRIMITIVE a forced transition uses is already pixel-validated by PART A
   (glyphs/score) + PART B (tubes/object vectors) — only the RNG-forked pixel *composition* of the tail is not
   byte-compared, which the clock-free design makes infeasible. **Re-verified:** `pixel_suite` PART C line +
   the 39-test whole-game suite green. Bounded, player-invisible, teethed at the state level.
2. **Grounding-debt irreducibles (17, all accounted).** Each is a cell whose named role-write is gated behind a
   branch never reached on a good ROM in any reproducible capture: the RAM-march self-test fault tones
   (d8ca/d8cd/d92f/d931), the EAROM region-erase / clear-scores path (dde9/dded), the `loc_ccc7 registerSound`
   code-fetch bytes cccb–ccce (misclassified as `VOICE_ENV_*` data, only ever fetched as code/operand), the
   ≥2-row sound-request SORT branch scratch (051e/051f/0520/061e/061f/0620), and 0xb955 `returnConstantTwo`
   (the active-object-slot draw arm). **Re-verified:** `grounding-debt.txt` holds exactly 17 entries; three
   spot-checked at source above (b955, 051e, and the closed d8ca tone-fault call-graph). All are the accepted
   caller-reached-but-branch-never-taken / dead-error-arm class.
3. **`vector_gate` byte-exact fraction (64.9%).** The stable/complete display-list frames render byte-for-byte
   identical to MAME; the ~35% non-exact frames are vector RAM sampled mid-AVG-walk by the offline dump (async
   to the AVG's list walk), a harness limitation, not a pipeline divergence. The 60% floor has teeth (the
   historical red-channel color bug made the fraction → ~0). **Re-verified:** `vector_gate: PASS`, 285/439 =
   64.9%. Bounded and honest.
4. **Pixel gameplay byte-exact is intentionally loose (19.7%).** A clock-free coin/start/fire replay
   reconverges with small per-frame residuals rather than landing byte-identical, so the gameplay floor is the
   within-1%-band (98.6%) + the R/B null-mutant tooth (→ 0), with the tight byte-exact anchor kept on the
   deterministic attract screens (PART A, 59.8% / 99.3%). A real gameplay/rendering regression blows past the
   band or collapses the null-mutant. **Re-verified:** PART B content=356, byte-exact 19.7%, within-band 98.6%,
   null-mutant → 0. Named, bounded, teethed.

**Also (expected per runbook §5):** the browser LIVE runtime — spinner feel and on-canvas render — is
human-confirm-only because node cannot drive pointer/canvas; the browser gate confirms the worker-form
construct/render/input/sound seam and a clean boot, and leaves live feel to a human, as the runbook prescribes
for a new render/input path (Tempest is arcade-js's first vector game).

## Conclusion

**Zero open criteria.** §3-completeness is established statically (idiomatic worklist total 0 / unlifted 0,
call=0 / addr=0 → every call a resolved JS import, a missing routine is a load-time failure) AND by clean
execution over attract + gameplay + the game-over transition, with a source-verified positive control that
bites on any unregistered routine or truncated run; the idiomatic gate is at 0 with nothing exempted; wiring,
naming, comments, grounding (17 accounted, three spot-checked irreducible at source), audio (per-voice
null-mutant over all 8 voices), whole-game input-tape replay + forced transitions, idiomatic equivalence (1297
tests with teeth), the byte-exact AVG→raster pipeline, and browser worker-boot are all green under their own
gates and independently re-verified; the pixel `--done` gate PASSes PART A + PART B with R/B null-mutant teeth
and PART C state-validated; **and the free-run idiomatic-vs-oracle display equivalence gate — the class-level
teeth that close the prior audit's exact blind spot — PASSes over 900 free-run attract frames with a
frame-130 mutation tooth**, confirming the `emitEnemySlotEntry` short-record display bug (found → fixed
`e6392c89` → gated `0599e3e0`) is corrected and cannot silently return. The four named residues are each
honest, bounded, player-invisible, and correctly gated. **tempest is DONE at commit `0599e3e0`** (== HEAD ==
`origin/main`). This `DONE.md` is unstaged working-tree; its commit will be cleared by an independent R40
confirmer that re-runs this full audit.
